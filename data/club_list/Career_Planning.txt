Bioethics Student Interest Group

The DGSOM Bio-Ethics group is a student-led interest group committed to providing students with a unique forum to learn about and discuss ethical issues as they pertain to human health, biomedical research, and clinical healthcare practices. Our goals are to stimulate discussion of potential ethical issues that students may encounter in their careers, and to equip students with several basic strategies to think through ethical dilemmas within a structured, rational framework. As a secondary objective, we aim to advocate for greater incorporation of medical ethics into the DGSOM curriculum. These objectives will be accomplished through student-led meetings, inviting guest speakers to discuss actual cases, and working with the DGSOM administration on curriculum reform projects. A student-led medical ethics panel will provide additional opportunities for students to discuss actual cases brought forth by fellow students, residents, or faculty, and to reinforce the knowledge gained from their interest in bioethics.

Bruin Mates

Bruin Mates is a new career networking organization for UCLA undergraduates. We have organized with the following founding board members; President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer, Director of Events, and Director of Marketing. We will hold four quarterly membership meetings, as well as bi-monthly networking functions including speakers from top tier LA-based companies. We do not plan to charge a membership fee to join, but we will charge a small event fee to cover the cost of each event (venue, refreshments, etc, - speakers will volunteer their time). We will promote our club on social media (Instagram, Reddit, Discord, and LinkedIn). And we will have a booth at the club day, where officers will recruit members and hand out flyers and stickers with our Bruin Mates logo. While UCLA is a large and vibrant campus, there are not enough clubs that serve students who want to participate in career enhancing activities on campus. This is evidenced by the very low acceptance rate into existing networking clubs. We will be a welcoming and inclusive business networking community without any requirements of major or GPA to discourage participation. Our founders include four-year and transfer students, students who live both on and off-campus, students with business, liberal arts and fine arts majors. We have substantial work experience and depth in the LA community that will enable us to attract corporate speakers and support. Our goal is to build a community of career-minded Bruins where we connect ambitious students with professionals in various industries so they can learn and build meaningful relationships. We hope to empower our club by providing events that connect our members to one another. We will do this by hosting various events such as club meetings, team bonding activities, and having guest speakers talk about their experience in their respective fields. The founding members are very excited to put our plans into action this fall. We appreciate your consideration and support. Thank you!

BruinSynaptoGenesis (BSG)

BruinSynaptoGenesis aims at building networks primarily between Psychology students (and all other departmental majors) and Professionals in all possible sectors the respective degree can be applied to. This includes, but is not limited to, collaborations with the fields of Law, Business, Academia, Non-Profit, Entertainment, Education, and Public Health. Our goal is to be the first organization at UCLA that fully exploits the potential of Psychology (and related degrees), which in spite of being one of the most popular majors at UCLA (2,000+ students) lacks an umbrella organization with ties to all fields. We will bring in professionals and faculty members for interactive sessions, collaborate with them for easier access to internships, and tie-up with clubs at UCLA to further expand these networks.

Data Ventures @ UCLA

Data Ventures @ UCLA is dedicated to empowering students with the essential skills and knowledge they need in data science and entrepreneurship. The organization provides a unique platform for students to explore how data influences business decisions, fosters an entrepreneurial mindset, and applies advanced data science techniques to tackle real-world challenges. Through a blend of workshops, case studies, and hands-on projects, students gain insights into the intersection of data science, business strategy, and innovation. The mission of Data Ventures is to equip students with the tools to leverage data science for understanding successful business strategies while promoting a supportive environment for entrepreneurial growth. By offering practical training and collaboration with industry professionals, students gain valuable experience with cutting-edge data science tools and technologies. This training enables them to develop innovative solutions for real business challenges and take advantage of emerging trends. Data Ventures offers two main tracks: the Data Science track and the Entrepreneurship track. The Data Science track emphasizes practical learning through the analysis of successful businesses like Amazon and Netflix. Students identify the key factors behind these companies’ successes and discover how data science fuels innovation. The organization hosts regular workshops on industry-standard tools like Python, R, and machine learning algorithms, helping students build strong technical skills. They also learn how companies use data for hyperpersonalization, targeted marketing, and developing new business models with big data and cloud computing. Additionally, this track covers future trends in data science, including AI, IoT, blockchain, and predictive analytics, ensuring students stay ahead of industry developments. The Entrepreneurship track is designed for students interested in launching their own ventures, aiming to foster a space where they can pursue creative ideas without the pressure of academic requirements or being confined to their majors. It offers mentorship, resources, and access to funding opportunities, promoting collaboration through an incubator program that helps students refine their innovative business ideas. By providing an environment that encourages innovation and the freedom to experiment, students can collaborate and develop new business concepts. Partnerships with venture capital firms, accelerators, and incubators offer real-world experience, mentorship from industry leaders, and opportunities to pitch their ideas in competitions. Collaboration is central to the organization’s growth strategy. Data Ventures partners with industry leaders and educational platforms like Socratica to offer students additional resources and networking opportunities. The organization emphasizes clear planning and development, backed by a well-defined mission, goals, and governance structure. Outreach efforts include professional branding and a user-friendly website that keeps students informed about upcoming events and workshops. Looking ahead, Data Ventures plans to launch advanced initiatives, such as a startup investment syndicate. This will allow members to apply their data science skills to evaluate and invest in promising startups, giving them hands-on experience in investment analysis and market trend evaluation. The organization also aims to collaborate with fintech startups and other companies at the forefront of technological advancements in data science.
