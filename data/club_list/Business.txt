Bruin Mates

Bruin Mates is a new career networking organization for UCLA undergraduates. We have organized with the following founding board members; President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer, Director of Events, and Director of Marketing. We will hold four quarterly membership meetings, as well as bi-monthly networking functions including speakers from top tier LA-based companies. We do not plan to charge a membership fee to join, but we will charge a small event fee to cover the cost of each event (venue, refreshments, etc, - speakers will volunteer their time). We will promote our club on social media (Instagram, Reddit, Discord, and LinkedIn). And we will have a booth at the club day, where officers will recruit members and hand out flyers and stickers with our Bruin Mates logo. While UCLA is a large and vibrant campus, there are not enough clubs that serve students who want to participate in career enhancing activities on campus. This is evidenced by the very low acceptance rate into existing networking clubs. We will be a welcoming and inclusive business networking community without any requirements of major or GPA to discourage participation. Our founders include four-year and transfer students, students who live both on and off-campus, students with business, liberal arts and fine arts majors. We have substantial work experience and depth in the LA community that will enable us to attract corporate speakers and support. Our goal is to build a community of career-minded Bruins where we connect ambitious students with professionals in various industries so they can learn and build meaningful relationships. We hope to empower our club by providing events that connect our members to one another. We will do this by hosting various events such as club meetings, team bonding activities, and having guest speakers talk about their experience in their respective fields. The founding members are very excited to put our plans into action this fall. We appreciate your consideration and support. Thank you!

Bruin Microfinance

Bruin Microfinance is UCLA’s Kiva chapter & first undergraduate microfinance institution. Here, we empower social mobility through financial services, one consulting and investment project at a time. We have two programs: a strategy consulting division and an investment fund. These programs work together to carry out quarterly projects where we partner with a small business in the Greater Los Angeles area, help them get a zero-interest microloan up to $15,000 on kiva.org, and provide strategy consulting services to help them succeed with the loan funds. Through this, we help borrowers change their lives financially while providing members with hands-on business experience. Our organization is a chapter of Kiva.org, a non-profit microfinance organization that provides microloans to people in need worldwide, especially in developing nations. These loans create opportunities for individuals to change their lives by jump-starting businesses, funding higher education, paying medical bills, and more. Once borrowers are successful, they repay their loans to the Kiva organization, where their funds are reused to create new opportunities, continuing the microloan cycle.

Sigma Eta Pi

Founded in 2010 at the University of California Los Angeles, Sigma Eta Pi is the first entrepreneurship fraternity on the West Coast and aims to support UCLA students’ entrepreneurial pursuits. We’re a diverse group of students of all majors with many interests but one in common- being drawn to and cultivating an entrepreneurial spirit. Members of Sigma Eta Pi have started over 21 different ventures. These include two backed by Y-Combinator (one of which was acquired by Square for $90 million), five fully funded projects (two by Venture Capital, three by crowd-sourced funding), and the largest hackathon the nation has ever seen. Apart from our student entrepreneurs, a majority of our members end up going to rising startups. On a more regular basis, we provide internal mentorship, alumni connections, private office tours, workshops, external info sessions, campus events, and most importantly, a community for entrepreneurially-minded students on UCLA’s campus.

Volunteer Income Tax Assistance

VITA at UCLA is a non-profit organization that has been serving the West Los Angeles community since 1987. Our goal is to provide income tax return assistance to those in need. We are committed to helping UCLA staff, undergraduate and graduate students, as well as anyone in nearby communities in need of tax assistance and education. Our target community population includes those in the Los Angeles community who fit any of the following descriptions: low-to-moderate income, elderly, disabled, non-English speaking, or individuals who are simply uninformed about the tax process. Almost everyone living in the United States must file both Federal and State taxes each year. The income tax filing process can be confusing and is often time consuming. It is important that returns are filed correctly so that the tax laws are followed, which may be difficult to do due to the confusing tax code. It has been and continues to be the goal of our program to help people with their taxes and educate them in the procedure of filing a return to help clarify the process and provide assistance to those who otherwise would go without aid. We offer UCLA students: • A great opportunity to give back to the community while gaining hands-on experience • Free training on individual income tax preparation • Strong resume builder with tax experience and community service • An opportunity to network with accounting/tax/consulting firms • IRS Certification
