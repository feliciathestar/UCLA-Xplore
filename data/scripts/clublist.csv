Through activities, mentorship, and community outreach, we hope to provide a community that encourages the potential and promise of those from underrepresented groups. By promoting and improving multicultural training in psychology, we hope to not only increase ethnic minority student recruitment, retention, and graduation but also improve intergroup relations within our department. UGSP operates with the following branches: UGSP Brown Bag Committee This committee organizes a lecture series that is open to all graduate students. These talks are given by faculty members and post-doctoral students from underrepresented backgrounds or whose research focuses on diversity issues. Each Brown Bag lecture includes both a research presentation and a career development component. This speaker series allows graduate students to network with prominent faculty members from underrepresented groups, hopefully fostering a sense social connectedness and community within the Psychology Department. UGSP Undergraduate Outreach Committee This committee organizes panels for undergraduate students to learn about various aspects of the graduate student experience. We hope to galvanize interest in graduate school by offering examples of successful underrepresented students from their own university. We also hope that this will provide undergraduates with the opportunity to connect with graduate students so they feel comfortable asking questions about diversity in graduate school. UGSP High School Outreach Committee As members of underrepresented groups, we find it imperative to give back to our communities through teaching, education, and service. UGSP will target high schools in low-income neighborhoods and will hold lectures for both parents and students about getting into college. UGSP Transfer Outreach Committee This committee is dedicated to providing resources and improving the experiences of the diverse group of transfer students at UCLA. A central goal of this committee is to serve transfers as they navigate their undergraduate experience and provide tools and information as they set future goals by creating/hosting events and building community between undergraduate and graduate students. UGSP Social Committee The Social Committee plans and coordinates various events each year, typically off campus.

Addiction Awareness Association (AAA),"Introduction: The Addiction Awareness Association (AAA) is a dynamic and dedicated college club committed to addressing one of the most pressing public health issues of our time – addiction. Founded on the principles of compassion, education, and community involvement, AAA has been making a profound impact on and off campus by raising awareness, preventing addiction, and connecting vulnerable communities with crucial rehabilitation resources. In this comprehensive description, we will delve into the mission, activities, and impact of AAA, highlighting its invaluable role in fostering a society that is better informed, more compassionate, and equipped to battle addiction. Mission and Vision: The core mission of the Addiction Awareness Association is to bridge the gap between local needs and rehabilitation resources to combat addiction effectively. AAA envisions a society where addiction is met with understanding, support, and accessible resources, rather than stigma and isolation. This vision is founded on the belief that addiction is a treatable illness, and those affected by it deserve a chance at recovery, regardless of their background. Key Objectives: 1. Awareness: AAA seeks to dispel myths and misconceptions surrounding addiction. Through workshops, seminars, and awareness campaigns, the club strives to educate the college community and the wider public about the root causes, consequences, and signs of addiction. 2. Prevention: AAA takes a proactive approach by working to prevent addiction before it takes hold. Club members engage in outreach programs to educate local schools, colleges, and communities about the dangers of substance abuse, providing information on risk factors and healthy coping strategies. 3. Rehabilitation: The heart of AAA's mission is to connect vulnerable communities with rehabilitation resources. Club members actively research and collaborate with local rehab centers, support groups, and counselors to ensure that those in need can access treatment and support. Approach: AAA operates on a needs-based approach, recognizing that addiction impacts different communities in various ways. The club seeks to understand the specific challenges faced by local communities and tailors its initiatives accordingly. This empathetic approach allows AAA to make a meaningful impact and build trust within the communities it serves. Activities and Initiatives: 1. Community Surveys: AAA conducts regular surveys and interviews within the local community to gauge the extent of addiction-related issues. These surveys are vital in identifying gaps in knowledge and resources. 2. Resource Coordination: Once needs are identified, AAA collaborates with local rehab centers, support groups, and healthcare providers to connect individuals struggling with addiction to appropriate resources. This includes organizing transportation, financial assistance, and counseling services. 3. Awareness Campaigns: AAA organizes a variety of awareness campaigns, from informational flyers and online webinars to panel discussions and guest speakers. These events aim to educate both the college campus and the wider community about addiction and its impact. 4. School Outreach: Members of AAA visit local schools to engage with students on the dangers of substance abuse, providing them with age-appropriate information and resources to make informed decisions. 5. Peer Support: The club runs support groups for individuals in recovery, providing a safe and non-judgmental space for sharing experiences and offering peer support. Impact: The Addiction Awareness Association's impact extends beyond the college campus. By focusing on local needs and collaborating with existing resources, AAA has played a pivotal role in improving the lives of individuals and communities affected by addiction. Some of the key impacts include: 1. Increased Awareness: AAA has reached thousands of individuals through its awareness campaigns, contributing to a better-informed society that is more empathetic towards those struggling with addiction. 2. Prevention: By educating local schools and colleges, AAA has helped prevent substance abuse among young adults, empowering them to make healthier choices. 3. Rehabilitation Support: Through its resource coordination efforts, AAA has facilitated hundreds of individuals' access to treatment, counseling, and support services. 4. Community Engagement: The club has fostered a sense of community among those affected by addiction, reducing isolation and stigma and promoting a supportive environment for recovery. Conclusion: The Addiction Awareness Association embodies the spirit of volunteerism, compassion, and community engagement. By addressing addiction at its core and working tirelessly to bridge the gap between local needs and rehabilitation resources, AAA has become a beacon of hope for individuals and communities grappling with the scourge of addiction.","Service, Medical",[addictionawarenessassociation@gmail.com](mailto:addictionawarenessassociation@gmail.com),,,,,,

Bridge at UCLA,"Bridge at UCLA is a workshop and mentorship based program that aims to bridge educational gaps for underprivileged high school students. Through our research on current educational support efforts, we discovered a generational gap between established programs and the high school students they serve. Although these efforts are still impactful, the support is not as relevant to the current day academic and career atmosphere, and the connection between mentors and mentees is less meaningful. This inspired us to create a university based program that runs off current students that have relevant experience in these areas. Bridge at UCLA aims to increase graduation rates through a mentorship program between collegiate students (at UCLA) and low-income students between the 10-12 grade range in local public schools. Our intent strays from increasing application turnout; instead, focusing on building strong professional skills to demonstrate career paths stemming from a high school diploma. As undergraduates with firsthand experience within higher education and the job market, our initiative is unique and relevant to high schools. On campus, we will recruit students through club fairs and departmental advertisements. We will search for students who are motivated to help youth, and train them to lead workshops and become one-on-one mentors. The workshops will be focused on a 5 stage curriculum of skill building, as outlined in the presented Journey Map, including: resumes, interviewing, college advising, scholarship opportunities, and academic tutoring. However, a major aspect of this program will be its emphasis on existing opportunities that are available to students looking to join the workforce, utilizing skillful development from our program. The mentorship program fosters meaningful connections between volunteers and students to provide personalized support for creating a future pathway, with emphasis on empowerment and student-led connection during the program. Thus, rather than serving several students at once per mentor, we will cater the experience to be more individualized and direct. We will approach this initiative by partnering with schools in LAUSD, specifically those in low-income regions. This will personalize our approach to the schools because we will better understand what the students need, learning from both staff and students.","Service - Community Involvement, Service - Outreach",[bridge.ucla@gmail.com](mailto:bridge.ucla@gmail.com),,,https://www.instagram.com/uclabridge/?__d=1%2F,,,

Children that face the world with a difference also endure the challenge of a more silent, but just as damaging, form of stigma: that of unconscious bias. And so, many children with differences grow up in a world that tells them that their dreams must be smaller than those of their peers. Magical Moments is working to change all of that. We create magical experiences that restore hope and provide comfort, inspiration, and encouragement to children with facial differences that are the result of genetic disorders, congenital anomalies, cancer treatment, severe trauma and burns. We help children understand that they are not at all limited by their appearance, but only by the size of their dreams! Through the magical moments that we create, we not only make a difference in children’s lives, but we also promote awareness of the lifelong harm caused by appearance-related stigma and create more widespread acceptance of facial diversity within our communities.

Neurodiversity Health Chats at UCLA,"Neurodiversity Health Chats (NDHC) is originally a student led project (now club) led by Dr. Emily Hotez, Ph.D. and the UC-LEND clinic-- and funded by the Association of University Centers on Disabilities (AUCD)-- that seeks to improve the health and well-being of neurodivergent individuals through outreach and education. Since 2021, NDHC has improved access to resources and credible information for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD). NDHC is directly responsive to the well-established findings that neurodivergent populations have experienced disproportionate negative mental and physical health outcomes from the COVID-19 pandemic. NDHC applies a multi-pronged strategy to support neurodivergent populations. First, NDHC leverages social media to translate and disseminate valuable information on vaccination guidelines, needle anxieties, and barriers to vaccination. NDHC is highly adept at creating and disseminating plain language and accessible social media infographics through a range of channels, as well as conducting and sharing in-depth interviews with public health experts and individuals with lived experience. In addition to these outreach efforts, NDHC leads a portfolio of research. Last year, NDHC conducted a qualitative research study that analyzed key themes from interviews with medical and non-medical health professionals, communicators, and individuals with I/DD and their caregivers. Qualitative findings revealed that misinformation, vaccine risk perception, sensory sensitivities, and structural hardship were the most significant barriers to COVID-19 vaccination. In order to be responsive to the findings from our research study, NDHC embarked on the development and dissemination of a virtual CME/CE to promote vaccine confidence, access, and uptake in neurodivergent populations.","Medical, Service - Outreach",[ndhealthchats@gmail.com](mailto:ndhealthchats@gmail.com),[https://uc-lend.med.ucla.edu/newsletters-and-blog-posts/neurodiversity-health-chats](https://uc-lend.med.ucla.edu/newsletters-and-blog-posts/neurodiversity-health-chats),,https://www.instagram.com/ndhealthchats/,https://twitter.com/NDHealthChats,,

The club members meet weekly during the school year to prepare lessons and practice lab demonstrations. The lessons on different STEM subjects are taught by the club members at local schools, catering to the interests of students of all age ranges. The emphasis is on teaching students in K-5 branches of physics such as electricity, magnetism, waves, and optics; however, we often branch out to other fields in STEM. Each lesson is accompanied by several spectacular demonstrations using the real laboratory equipment provided by the Department’s demo lab as well as presentations and additional demos designed and built by the club members. The club members strongly believe that in order to get children interested in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) subjects, science education should start at a very early age and each lesson should become a memorable experience for the kids. Club members have given presentations at the following schools: Norra Sterry Elementary School, Citizens of the World Mar Vista Charter School, Emerson Middle School, Palms Middle School, Fairburn Elementary School, Brentwood Science Magnet Elementary, and others. Undergraduate club member Nick Vincent has expressed his own enthusiasm for the program. ""The Science Teaching Club at UCLA gave me a great way to become involved in the community,"" said Nick. ""It encouraged me to use my passion for science to benefit local elementary schools. I think that my work with the Science Teaching Club has greatly augmented my education.

Yet, people experiencing homelessness may not have access to the technology needed to grow these skills. Given the existing hardships and disadvantages in the job market, learning tech literacy skills would help increase the amount and types of jobs this population can apply for. This can also be applied to other populations that struggle with tech literacy skills such as people from low income areas, elderly adults, and those who are returning from incarceration. While growing in tech literacy cannot knock down every barrier, having basic tech literacy skills brings us one step closer to an inclusive job market. Today, TechUp LA has partnered with seven local organizations throughout LA County where we provide monthly workshops to individuals on the basics of smartphones and computers.

Teens for Screens at UCLA,"As part of efforts to come up with a new model for community outreach about breast cancer, UCSF's San Francisco Cancer Initiative Breast Cancer Task Force (SFCAN) discussed the idea of Teens for Screens (T4S) in 2018. In the course of numerous meetings and collaboration with community-based organizations geared toward the underserved population of San Francisco, the concept of creating a sustainable model of outreach to raise awareness of breast cancer among youth to educate their families and communities was developed. In addition to the support of SFCAN through the funding and resources they provided, the T4S pilot program would not have been possible without the leadership of Dr. Laura Fejerman, Dr. Ana Velasquez, Tania Dugatkin, and UCSF staff. We recognize them for the time, passion, support, and dedication they have contributed to T4S. In the Fall of 2019, T4S launched and empowered high school students with information to advocate for breast cancer screenings and healthy behaviors among their friends, families, and communities. In this vein, Teens for Screens at UCLA has adopted this model with a twist. To implement this model, UCLA Teens for Screens seeks to train undergraduate students as breast cancer educators to have them educate middle and high schoolers locally either in-person or remotely. As part of our outreach efforts, we aim to partner with high schools with high populations of underserved groups, such as low-income students and minorities, to provide them with information about breast cancer and the importance of screening. We also aim to provide one-on-one mentorship, with a culminating capstone project at the end of each program.

Classroom Care,"Classroom Care is a non-profit organization and current club at Chatsworth Charter High School (CCHS) that utilizes communities of motivated students to work together in order to create seasonal gift bags for children at schools in low-income communities while making fun, kid-friendly Youtube videos that include craft tutorials, book readings, and entertaining games for the children to watch in class. I started Classroom Care during the summer of 2022 in order to spread joy to children in low-income communities. After completing my sophomore year of high school, I reflected on my past and remembered the many fond memories of my childhood that I currently hold onto. Because these memories have comforted me on my path towards adulthood, I believe that all children are deserving of creating special memories they can carry with them as they grow older, regardless of their family’s financial position. I reached out to my fellow students at CCHS to form a student-led board to help me run the Classroom Care club and by using Classroom Care’s Instagram account, I was able to generate interest in the club and find members who shared a common interest in helping younger generations. As Classroom Care grew, I raised funds from friends and family through Snap Raise and held fundraisers at local restaurants who gave the organization a percentage of the profits. I also created classroomcare.org, which allows more people to donate to the organization online. Due to the additional funding of over $4,000 raised, Classroom Care was able to expand its services into more classrooms, allowing more students to be included. Club members would also visit the students in person, first thing in the morning, before our high school opened at 10:00 am on Tuesdays. We would read books to the kids and bring craft projects to do with them. After Classroom Care’s first year, the club board decided to create a Youtube Channel in order to reach students that we were unable to visit in person, specifically because CCHS eliminated late-start Tuesdays which made it more difficult to do personal class visits. Each monthly video is dedicated to a holiday or season. Members in the videos are dressed according to that month’s theme, and they are filmed packing the students’ gifts, reading children’s books, making a no-bake treat, partaking in challenges, and walking the kids through a craft tutorial for a craft that each student receives beforehand in their gift package. The videos are designed to be played by the students’ teacher, who distributes our gift packages to them. To further expand Classroom Care, I wrote a children’s book, Peach Pit, that was inspired by the students I have met while visiting their classrooms. The kids get very excited when I read them stories, so I decided to write a book that they could enjoy and learn from. The book was released on Amazon in December of 2023 and 100% of the profits go towards Classroom Care. At UCLA, I would like to continue my passion for volunteer work for children and expand the organization's reach by generating a larger volume of club members who are also dedicated to making an impact in the lives of so many young students. I want to continue utilizing my creativity by filming and editing Youtube videos, creating media, and planning club events while also regularly visiting classrooms in person. With the combined efforts of UCLA students, Classroom Care can increase its influence and make use of the ideas of students from all different backgrounds.","Community Service, Educational",[classroomcarecorp@gmail.com](mailto:classroomcarecorp@gmail.com),[http://classroomcare.org](http://classroomcare.org/),,https://www.instagram.com/classroom.care?igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ==,,,

Many even refuse to air out their feet, conducive of many foot problems, afraid that their shoes might get stolen. As we, Happy Feet Clinic, provide those basic necessities and more, we are blessed with a powerfully humbling experience. At shelters around Los Angeles, including the Union Rescue Mission in downtown L.A., the Ocean Park Community Center in Santa Monica, the New Image Emergency Shelter in South LA, and PATH in Westwood, we treat hundreds of homeless people to a soothing foot wash in a tub of warm, soapy water. Next, we work side by side with podiatrists as they administer foot exams for the homeless community. Throughout the process, we interact with a variety of people in need of help and most importantly become aware of the large prominence of under-served communities and their critical need for assistance. For many students, it is hard to grasp how prominent this population is in a thriving country as America. At first, students squirm at the thought of washing feet (especially those that may need much more care than our own). As soon as the event comes to an end however, many are instilled with the feeling to return again and again. The power to help someone who has lost family, work, and shelter and put a smile on their face is an amazing feeling. This is what makes our organization unique.

Volunteers work with health professionals, build leadership in health-related community service, interact with patients, become educated on predominant community health issues, and have workshops to help make them strong leaders in the health field and community. VCH members will be provided with numerous opportunities for community service, leadership development, and mentorship opportunities. Community service opportunities include quarterly VCH-sponsored health fairs, biweekly health sites, and participation at community health fairs sponsored by non-profit organizations that VCH partners with. In addition, there is a leadership development ""internship"" offered each winter quarter.

The media has given us a specific image of what is beautiful, and we want to encourage every student on campus to feel confident and beautiful no matter how their body looks. By improving our self esteem, we can focus less time on our physical appearance and more time on living our lives. We hope to enhance the self esteem of students by demonstrating beauty isn’t only skin-deep, and by pushing students to be positive with themselves and not to be so critical. We also want to show how physical health affects mental health. We want to teach students ways to take care of their own health which will help them feel better. For instance we emphasize healthy eating and fitness, but encourage individuals to focus on feeling good rather than looking good. We want to make help accessible to those who are struggling with body dismorphia or eating disorders. Through our programming, we hope to educate the student body on these issues and how to tackle them. The Body Image Task Force also aims to help students learn how to handle college stress. We hope to provide stress outlets because we believe that mental health is also connected to self esteem and in general happiness. As students, we all face a variety of obstacles that can ultimately hold us back.

The Hidden Opponent x Sports Psychology Club,"The Hidden Opponent x Sports Psychology Club (THO x SPC) is designed to promote mental health to the student-athletes on campus. We would work hand in hand with the coaches and student-athletes to give them access to mental health resources that are designed specifically for student-athletes. Everyone undergoes stress at school, but there is a stigma surrounding student-athletes and how they manage their stress. With the stress of school on top of their sport, we could find ways to reduce the stressors in their lives, while giving them information and guidance about how they can value the importance of their mental health. We would provide student outreach programs specifically for the student-athletes that raise awareness about the importance of mental health. One example of this could be by bringing in a licensed clinical sports psychologist who is trained to work with professional athletes to campus, and hold a seminar for the student-athletes so they could learn from a professional. The main goal of this club is to provide positive mental health resources and spread awareness for this particular group of students, because sports psychology is very niche and overlooked. Hopefully, this club will serve as a way to positively incorporate mental health into the lives of student-athletes, and raise awareness for any mental health-related issues these students may be experiencing. We will also make this club extremely accessible for the student-athletes themselves, because we understand it is hard for these students to get involved in clubs on campus due to their busy schedules. We would do so by holding meetings on Google Meet as well as in-person, as that may be easier to fit into their busy schedules if they would like to join. We will also provide detailed notes and announcements via Google Classroom, Slack, and email. This way, if students do not have time to watch or attend meetings, they can stay in the loop and still be involved in the club to whatever capacity they can contribute. We will also definitely reach out to the coaches privately, and ask them if there are any specific things they think would be beneficial to help their student-athletes during the academic year. We would also love to administer a survey to all the student-athletes, where they could give us their anonymous opinions about things they are stressed about, so we could try to find ways to alleviate those stressors. We are also an official chapter of ""The Hidden Opponent"", a nationwide nonprofit organization that promotes mental health awareness for student-athletes across high school and college campuses. With this organization, we are able to provide resources and break the stigma on mental health in sports. We work with the NCAA and Club Sports Teams to host mental health awareness games, where we shine light on the importance of mental health with the help of a specific sports team. Working with ""The Hidden Opponent"" is an amazing way to promote mental health awareness in sports to student-athletes, as well as any student who either partakes in a sport on or off campus, or has a passion for mental health in the sports industry.","Health and Wellness, Sports",[thoxsportspsychclub@gmail.com](mailto:thoxsportspsychclub@gmail.com),[https://linktr.ee/thoxsportspsychclubucla](https://linktr.ee/thoxsportspsychclubucla),,http://www.instagram.com/thoxspcucla,,,

Bruin Undergraduate Policy Review,"Bruin Undergraduate Policy Review (BUPR) is a nonpartisan undergraduate journal and policy institute at UCLA dedicated to promoting rigorous, evidence-based analysis of public policy. We are a student-run organization that empowers undergraduates to engage directly with pressing policy issues through research, writing, discussion, and professional development. BUPR provides a platform for students of all academic backgrounds and political perspectives to analyze public policy in depth, develop their voice as policy thinkers, and contribute to meaningful public dialogue. We believe that policy is at the heart of how society addresses its greatest challenges—whether it’s regulating artificial intelligence, reforming healthcare systems, reducing economic inequality, addressing climate change, or strengthening democratic institutions. Our mission is to help UCLA students not only understand these issues, but actively participate in the conversations that shape their outcomes. BUPR operates on three central pillars: 1. Publishing – Our online journal regularly publishes high-quality student-written articles and op-eds on a wide range of policy topics. Every article is edited collaboratively and held to high standards of evidence, clarity, and argumentation. Writers may choose to analyze existing legislation, examine the implications of a particular policy proposal, or compare different approaches to a societal challenge. We publish both analytical features and shorter, opinion-driven pieces—allowing students to explore a topic with depth or express a clear policy stance supported by research. 2. Legislative Newsletter – Each week, BUPR distributes a student-produced newsletter that highlights key legislative developments in various sectors, including technology, health, education, environment, and economic policy. Sector Leads track federal and state-level developments, summarize the core elements of proposed or passed bills, and offer brief context on their potential implications. The newsletter aims to help students stay informed about fast-moving policy landscapes in a concise, accessible format. 3. Speaker Events and Career Development – To connect academic inquiry with professional pathways, BUPR hosts speaker events featuring experts across the policy landscape. These include analysts from think tanks, government officials, attorneys, legislative staffers, nonprofit leaders, and others working at the intersection of policy and practice. Events are held either over Zoom or in person and are designed to expose students to a variety of career paths while creating opportunities to network with professionals in the field. We also plan resume-building workshops, internship panels, and career Q&As. Organizational Structure: BUPR is entirely student-led and structured to encourage collaboration and leadership development. The organization is overseen by an executive board consisting of the President, Vice President, Director of Publications, Treasurer, Director of Outreach, and a team of Sector Leads. Each Sector Lead manages a policy area (e.g., Economic Policy, Tech Policy, Health Policy), guides writers, and contributes to the weekly newsletter. Editors support writers through research help, feedback, and article development. We are proudly bipartisan and inclusive, providing space for a wide range of ideological perspectives—as long as arguments are grounded in evidence, respectful discourse, and a sincere interest in public policy. Our editorial standards prioritize analytical rigor, respectful debate, and intellectual humility. How to Get Involved: All UCLA undergraduate students are welcome to apply to join BUPR. We accept new members at the beginning of each quarter, though students may express interest at any time. Opportunities include becoming a: Staff Writer: Contribute 1–2 articles per quarter on topics of your choice, with support from Sector Leads and editors. Sector Lead: Manage a policy area, support writers, and compile weekly legislative updates. Editor: Work with writers to develop content and maintain publication quality. Outreach or Events Team Member: Help promote our work, recruit members, and organize speaker sessions We are especially excited to work with students who are passionate about policy but may not have formal writing experience—our editorial process is collaborative and designed to help students grow as thinkers and communicators.","Political, Educational",[elianabernstein@g.ucla.edu](mailto:elianabernstein@g.ucla.edu),,,https://www.instagram.com/bruinundergradpolicyreview?igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ%3D%3D&utm_source=qr,,,

Classroom Care,"Classroom Care is a non-profit organization and current club at Chatsworth Charter High School (CCHS) that utilizes communities of motivated students to work together in order to create seasonal gift bags for children at schools in low-income communities while making fun, kid-friendly Youtube videos that include craft tutorials, book readings, and entertaining games for the children to watch in class. I started Classroom Care during the summer of 2022 in order to spread joy to children in low-income communities. After completing my sophomore year of high school, I reflected on my past and remembered the many fond memories of my childhood that I currently hold onto. Because these memories have comforted me on my path towards adulthood, I believe that all children are deserving of creating special memories they can carry with them as they grow older, regardless of their family’s financial position. I reached out to my fellow students at CCHS to form a student-led board to help me run the Classroom Care club and by using Classroom Care’s Instagram account, I was able to generate interest in the club and find members who shared a common interest in helping younger generations. As Classroom Care grew, I raised funds from friends and family through Snap Raise and held fundraisers at local restaurants who gave the organization a percentage of the profits. I also created classroomcare.org, which allows more people to donate to the organization online. Due to the additional funding of over $4,000 raised, Classroom Care was able to expand its services into more classrooms, allowing more students to be included. Club members would also visit the students in person, first thing in the morning, before our high school opened at 10:00 am on Tuesdays. We would read books to the kids and bring craft projects to do with them. After Classroom Care’s first year, the club board decided to create a Youtube Channel in order to reach students that we were unable to visit in person, specifically because CCHS eliminated late-start Tuesdays which made it more difficult to do personal class visits. Each monthly video is dedicated to a holiday or season. Members in the videos are dressed according to that month’s theme, and they are filmed packing the students’ gifts, reading children’s books, making a no-bake treat, partaking in challenges, and walking the kids through a craft tutorial for a craft that each student receives beforehand in their gift package. The videos are designed to be played by the students’ teacher, who distributes our gift packages to them. To further expand Classroom Care, I wrote a children’s book, Peach Pit, that was inspired by the students I have met while visiting their classrooms. The kids get very excited when I read them stories, so I decided to write a book that they could enjoy and learn from. The book was released on Amazon in December of 2023 and 100% of the profits go towards Classroom Care. At UCLA, I would like to continue my passion for volunteer work for children and expand the organization's reach by generating a larger volume of club members who are also dedicated to making an impact in the lives of so many young students. I want to continue utilizing my creativity by filming and editing Youtube videos, creating media, and planning club events while also regularly visiting classrooms in person. With the combined efforts of UCLA students, Classroom Care can increase its influence and make use of the ideas of students from all different backgrounds.","Community Service, Educational",[classroomcarecorp@gmail.com](mailto:classroomcarecorp@gmail.com),[http://classroomcare.org](http://classroomcare.org/),,https://www.instagram.com/classroom.care?igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ==,,,

Everyday Responder Project @ UCLA,"According to a study conducted in 2017, the average EMS response time is about 6 minutes. However, this number was roughly doubled in rural settings, with nearly 1 in 10 encounters resulting in a wait time of over half an hour. When applying these metrics to some of the leading causes of death in the emergency prehospital setting (cardiac arrest and traumatic bleeding), an issue becomes apparent – time. The brain begins to suffer damage after roughly 4 minutes without oxygen and progresses toward irreversible damage after about 7 minutes. There are about half a million deaths from cardiac arrest in the U.S. every year, but a study conducted in 2009 revealed that, out of 138 bystanders who called 911 for a cardiac-related emergency, about half of the cardiac arrests were not detected. Similar patterns can be observed in bleeding emergencies, with over one-third of mortality from all traumatic injuries being attributed to severe hemorrhage and roughly 50% of hemorrhage-related deaths occurring before reaching a hospital. With most medical emergencies benefitting from immediate intervention, an effective approach to improving patient outcomes involves placing everyday people at the forefront of the medical care team. Understanding how to effectively engage the emergency response system and provide basic first aid (i.e. bleed control and CPR) can drastically improve a patient’s likelihood of survival. Previous research has highlighted the efficacy of bystander training programs in improving patient outcomes and increasing bystander confidence in providing medical aid: “Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) by laypersons (so-called bystanders) improves the chances of survival by a factor of 2-4” - Current Opinion in Critical Care (2015). “The proportion of students showing willingness to perform BLS increased from 13% to 77% after \[training\] even when the collapsed person is a stranger” — Resuscitation (2016). With the aim of improving accessibility to bystander medical training, the Everyday Responder Project (ERP) was founded in December 2020 by two students at the University of Southern California. The current ERP team consists of a variety of healthcare, educational, and creative professionals who are passionate about developing and teaching medical content. With the help of ERP’s volunteers, the organization has begun to pilot its core curriculum and work on larger, longitudinal projects that will help improve medical literacy and emergency preparedness in the various communities across California and beyond.","Health and Wellness, Educational",[srikarchintala@g.ucla.edu](mailto:srikarchintala@g.ucla.edu),[http://www.everydayresponderproject.org](http://www.everydayresponderproject.org/),,,,,

Collectively, members aim to support the local community in promoting medical communication to help reduce clinical anxiety in children. Our various stations run as 'hospitals' for children's teddy bears and are designed as a hands-on experience that allows children to better understand healthcare, reduce medical associated fears, and inspire them to pursue higher education. Our organization offers allied-health students opportunities to practice working with children and experience teaching health care. Students learn important pediatric communication skills, such as building rapport and using child-friendly language. Volunteers diffuse complex medical information and explain important health questions to participating children. Vision In our Teddy Bear Hospital mock hospital sessions, children will bring a beloved teddy (or are loaned one) and treat their teddy bears with empathy, learn about patient care, and discover careers in medicine. Through our team, we strive for creating a fun and relaxed atmosphere to create a positive experience in medicine. With these interactions, TBH aims to ease any fears and anxieties concerning doctors' visits, hospital settings, and/or medical procedures. Objectives 1. Medical Literacy: Introducing children to healthcare concepts through interactive check-ups with their teddy bears. Through hands-on teaching, we empower kids with medical knowledge and encourage future careers in healthcare. 2. Community: Connecting children, undergraduates, medical students, nursing students, residents, physicians, and local healthcare professionals through engaging hospital sessions at elementary schools. Collecting support from various organizations to collaborate for a culture of health within the community 3. Well-Being: By creating a fun and relaxed environment, we help children overcome anxieties about medical visits. Our activities promote healthy habits and instill confidence, paving the way for lifelong positive attitudes toward healthcare. Unique Value Proposition Teddy Bear Hospital DGSOM is unique in that it utilizes a play based approach to encourage children to be involved in their healthcare. We hope to use this approach to foster interest in health and higher education specifically in low SES areas in LA county.

From various backgrounds, beliefs, and positions, we unite here with the collective goal to alleviate society's communication gap: to move forward, we must find common ground. As a collective, we wish not to push specific beliefs or opinions; rather, we want to create and facilitate a safe space for communication between disagreeing groups, as this current environment is lacking at UCLA and in broader society. We first aim to set up a Public Forum for deliberation on various topics to achieve this goal. These forums aren't meant to decide a winner or which side is right. The purpose of these forums is for disagreeing groups to gain a better understanding of one another. A student moderator assigned by our club board will ensure discourse remains respectful and the goal of understanding is accomplished. The Public Forum is the only event we have committed to planning as of now, but we plan to branch out further into the UCLA community as the organization expands. All future events, regardless of what they may be, will always hold the same fundamental goals: to promote understanding, foster a safe environment for discourse, and find common ground while not negating the importance of varying views.

Bruin Mates,"Bruin Mates is a new career networking organization for UCLA undergraduates. We have organized with the following founding board members; President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer, Director of Events, and Director of Marketing. We will hold four quarterly membership meetings, as well as bi-monthly networking functions including speakers from top tier LA-based companies. We do not plan to charge a membership fee to join, but we will charge a small event fee to cover the cost of each event (venue, refreshments, etc, - speakers will volunteer their time). We will promote our club on social media (Instagram, Reddit, Discord, and LinkedIn). And we will have a booth at the club day, where officers will recruit members and hand out flyers and stickers with our Bruin Mates logo. While UCLA is a large and vibrant campus, there are not enough clubs that serve students who want to participate in career enhancing activities on campus. This is evidenced by the very low acceptance rate into existing networking clubs. We will be a welcoming and inclusive business networking community without any requirements of major or GPA to discourage participation. Our founders include four-year and transfer students, students who live both on and off-campus, students with business, liberal arts and fine arts majors. We have substantial work experience and depth in the LA community that will enable us to attract corporate speakers and support. Our goal is to build a community of career-minded Bruins where we connect ambitious students with professionals in various industries so they can learn and build meaningful relationships. We hope to empower our club by providing events that connect our members to one another. We will do this by hosting various events such as club meetings, team bonding activities, and having guest speakers talk about their experience in their respective fields. The founding members are very excited to put our plans into action this fall. We appreciate your consideration and support.

We believe that the bible calls us to be excellent in all areas of life and that includes our education. We encourage students to be disciplined in their studies and keep an excellent work ethic as they study the bible and attend their classes. These bible studies have changed the lives of so many individuals. We've had people come addicted to drugs, plagued with anxiety and stress, hurt emotionally, with no hope and the list goes on and on. We help them see that God has a plan for their life and show them what a life with God could look like. So many have seen true happiness and hope for the very first time and their lives are forever changed. Outside of personal bible studies we offer club meetings throughout the week as well as a Sunday service with the home church we are apart of.

"Gamma Zeta Alpha Fraternity, Inc.","In 1987, fifteen men came together to found what would later become known as Gamma Zeta Alpha Fraternity, Inc. -- Recognizing the difficulties facing Latinos in higher education, the founders sought to create an organization aimed at developing leadership, instilling academic scholarship, and creating an environment of support that integrated Latino heritage. After realizing that other student organizations would not be able to provide all of these to their members, the founders decided that creating a fraternity, something that was new in Latino culture, would be the best opportunity for achieving its goals. -- Our founders instilled in us the principles of Academic Excellence, through which we will encourage and support Latino males in higher education; Community Service, through which we will give back to the communities that shaped our lives; and the Maintenance of Latino Culture through Brotherhood in establishing the FIRST Latino-Based Organization on the West Coast. -- In 2000, when six gentlemen realized that other student organizations at UCLA would not be able to provide them with opportunities for personal growth, networking, and a chance to contribute meaningfully to both the UCLA campus and the surrounding community, they decided to establish a chapter of this fraternity to provide them the opportunity to achieve these goals. -- Eta Chapter prides itself on being established at the number one public university in the nation. Since it’s inception on January 15th, 2000, Eta Chapter has had a 99% graduation rate, leading to an extensive alumni network with brothers working in a range of professional fields from finance to city government, medicine, law, and everywhere in between. We are not members of this brotherhood for the short time that we are at UCLA; we are members of this brotherhood for a lifetime. -- At UCLA, we strive to uplift all our brothers and their respective communities. Having multiple brothers from diverse backgrounds, such as the undocumented, LGBTQ+, transfer, and other various historically underrepresented populations, gives us the opportunity to contribute to the betterment of each of these communities. Through a combination of brotherhood, service, and leadership development, the fraternity strives to create well-rounded individuals who are prepared to lead and inspire others to excel. -- Eta Chapter offers a supportive environment where individuals can cultivate lifelong friendships, engage in philanthropic endeavors, and participate in various social and educational activities. By upholding our core values, we play an essential role in enriching the campus community and empowering our members to make a positive impact in society. -- For more than two decades, Gamma Zeta Alpha Fraternity, Inc. at ETA Chapter has been cultivating leaders and strengthening the Latino community at UCLA. As the LARGEST, and LONGEST-STANDING Latino-Based Organization, we will continue to produce sustainability that benefits our surrounding communities here at UCLA.","Greek Life - Fraternities, Academic",[president.gammas.eta@gmail.com](mailto:president.gammas.eta@gmail.com),[https://gammas.org/](https://gammas.org/),,https://www.instagram.com/bruin_gammas/?hl=en,,,

Bridge at UCLA,"Bridge at UCLA is a workshop and mentorship based program that aims to bridge educational gaps for underprivileged high school students. Through our research on current educational support efforts, we discovered a generational gap between established programs and the high school students they serve. Although these efforts are still impactful, the support is not as relevant to the current day academic and career atmosphere, and the connection between mentors and mentees is less meaningful. This inspired us to create a university based program that runs off current students that have relevant experience in these areas. Bridge at UCLA aims to increase graduation rates through a mentorship program between collegiate students (at UCLA) and low-income students between the 10-12 grade range in local public schools. Our intent strays from increasing application turnout; instead, focusing on building strong professional skills to demonstrate career paths stemming from a high school diploma. As undergraduates with firsthand experience within higher education and the job market, our initiative is unique and relevant to high schools. On campus, we will recruit students through club fairs and departmental advertisements. We will search for students who are motivated to help youth, and train them to lead workshops and become one-on-one mentors. The workshops will be focused on a 5 stage curriculum of skill building, as outlined in the presented Journey Map, including: resumes, interviewing, college advising, scholarship opportunities, and academic tutoring. However, a major aspect of this program will be its emphasis on existing opportunities that are available to students looking to join the workforce, utilizing skillful development from our program. The mentorship program fosters meaningful connections between volunteers and students to provide personalized support for creating a future pathway, with emphasis on empowerment and student-led connection during the program. Thus, rather than serving several students at once per mentor, we will cater the experience to be more individualized and direct. We will approach this initiative by partnering with schools in LAUSD, specifically those in low-income regions. This will personalize our approach to the schools because we will better understand what the students need, learning from both staff and students.","Service - Community Involvement, Service - Outreach",[bridge.ucla@gmail.com](mailto:bridge.ucla@gmail.com),,,https://www.instagram.com/uclabridge/?__d=1%2F,,,

In this comprehensive description, we will delve into the mission, activities, and impact of AAA, highlighting its invaluable role in fostering a society that is better informed, more compassionate, and equipped to battle addiction. Mission and Vision: The core mission of the Addiction Awareness Association is to bridge the gap between local needs and rehabilitation resources to combat addiction effectively. AAA envisions a society where addiction is met with understanding, support, and accessible resources, rather than stigma and isolation. This vision is founded on the belief that addiction is a treatable illness, and those affected by it deserve a chance at recovery, regardless of their background. Key Objectives: 1. Awareness: AAA seeks to dispel myths and misconceptions surrounding addiction. Through workshops, seminars, and awareness campaigns, the club strives to educate the college community and the wider public about the root causes, consequences, and signs of addiction. 2. Prevention: AAA takes a proactive approach by working to prevent addiction before it takes hold. Club members engage in outreach programs to educate local schools, colleges, and communities about the dangers of substance abuse, providing information on risk factors and healthy coping strategies. 3. Rehabilitation: The heart of AAA's mission is to connect vulnerable communities with rehabilitation resources. Club members actively research and collaborate with local rehab centers, support groups, and counselors to ensure that those in need can access treatment and support. Approach: AAA operates on a needs-based approach, recognizing that addiction impacts different communities in various ways. The club seeks to understand the specific challenges faced by local communities and tailors its initiatives accordingly. This empathetic approach allows AAA to make a meaningful impact and build trust within the communities it serves. Activities and Initiatives: 1. Community Surveys: AAA conducts regular surveys and interviews within the local community to gauge the extent of addiction-related issues. These surveys are vital in identifying gaps in knowledge and resources. 2. Resource Coordination: Once needs are identified, AAA collaborates with local rehab centers, support groups, and healthcare providers to connect individuals struggling with addiction to appropriate resources. This includes organizing transportation, financial assistance, and counseling services. 3. Awareness Campaigns: AAA organizes a variety of awareness campaigns, from informational flyers and online webinars to panel discussions and guest speakers. These events aim to educate both the college campus and the wider community about addiction and its impact. 4. School Outreach: Members of AAA visit local schools to engage with students on the dangers of substance abuse, providing them with age-appropriate information and resources to make informed decisions. 5. Peer Support: The club runs support groups for individuals in recovery, providing a safe and non-judgmental space for sharing experiences and offering peer support. Impact: The Addiction Awareness Association's impact extends beyond the college campus. By focusing on local needs and collaborating with existing resources, AAA has played a pivotal role in improving the lives of individuals and communities affected by addiction. Some of the key impacts include: 1. Increased Awareness: AAA has reached thousands of individuals through its awareness campaigns, contributing to a better-informed society that is more empathetic towards those struggling with addiction. 2. Prevention: By educating local schools and colleges, AAA has helped prevent substance abuse among young adults, empowering them to make healthier choices. 3. Rehabilitation Support: Through its resource coordination efforts, AAA has facilitated hundreds of individuals' access to treatment, counseling, and support services. 4. Community Engagement: The club has fostered a sense of community among those affected by addiction, reducing isolation and stigma and promoting a supportive environment for recovery. Conclusion: The Addiction Awareness Association embodies the spirit of volunteerism, compassion, and community engagement.

Happy Feet Clinic,"How to help L.A.’s homeless? One foot at a time. Without homes or any mode of transportation, hundreds of homeless people walk an average of 13 miles a day. Some walk for days, weeks, or months without having access to basic necessities such as clean water or properly fitted shoes. Many even refuse to air out their feet, conducive of many foot problems, afraid that their shoes might get stolen. As we, Happy Feet Clinic, provide those basic necessities and more, we are blessed with a powerfully humbling experience. At shelters around Los Angeles, including the Union Rescue Mission in downtown L.A., the Ocean Park Community Center in Santa Monica, the New Image Emergency Shelter in South LA, and PATH in Westwood, we treat hundreds of homeless people to a soothing foot wash in a tub of warm, soapy water. Next, we work side by side with podiatrists as they administer foot exams for the homeless community. Throughout the process, we interact with a variety of people in need of help and most importantly become aware of the large prominence of under-served communities and their critical need for assistance. For many students, it is hard to grasp how prominent this population is in a thriving country as America. At first, students squirm at the thought of washing feet (especially those that may need much more care than our own). As soon as the event comes to an end however, many are instilled with the feeling to return again and again. The power to help someone who has lost family, work, and shelter and put a smile on their face is an amazing feeling. This is what makes our organization unique.

It is our duty as student nurses to provide the best possible care to those we serve. In order to achieve this aim, we must learn to address our own internal biases and understand relevant historical and cultural context in order to advocate for our patients.

The focus of lunch and learn lectures, presentations, workshops, and participation in community health fairs is not only to educate students about lifestyle medicine and chronic illnesses such as diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity, but to help them integrate the experience that they will acquire in clinical settings and beyond.

First, NDHC leverages social media to translate and disseminate valuable information on vaccination guidelines, needle anxieties, and barriers to vaccination. NDHC is highly adept at creating and disseminating plain language and accessible social media infographics through a range of channels, as well as conducting and sharing in-depth interviews with public health experts and individuals with lived experience. In addition to these outreach efforts, NDHC leads a portfolio of research. Last year, NDHC conducted a qualitative research study that analyzed key themes from interviews with medical and non-medical health professionals, communicators, and individuals with I/DD and their caregivers. Qualitative findings revealed that misinformation, vaccine risk perception, sensory sensitivities, and structural hardship were the most significant barriers to COVID-19 vaccination.

Teddy Bear Hospital DGSOM,"Mission Statement Teddy Bear Hospital DGSOM is a branch of the Teddy Bear Hospital USA (TBH) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization run by medical students and undergraduate students. Collectively, members aim to support the local community in promoting medical communication to help reduce clinical anxiety in children. Our various stations run as 'hospitals' for children's teddy bears and are designed as a hands-on experience that allows children to better understand healthcare, reduce medical associated fears, and inspire them to pursue higher education. Our organization offers allied-health students opportunities to practice working with children and experience teaching health care. Students learn important pediatric communication skills, such as building rapport and using child-friendly language. Volunteers diffuse complex medical information and explain important health questions to participating children. Vision In our Teddy Bear Hospital mock hospital sessions, children will bring a beloved teddy (or are loaned one) and treat their teddy bears with empathy, learn about patient care, and discover careers in medicine. Through our team, we strive for creating a fun and relaxed atmosphere to create a positive experience in medicine. With these interactions, TBH aims to ease any fears and anxieties concerning doctors' visits, hospital settings, and/or medical procedures. Objectives 1. Medical Literacy: Introducing children to healthcare concepts through interactive check-ups with their teddy bears. Through hands-on teaching, we empower kids with medical knowledge and encourage future careers in healthcare. 2. Community: Connecting children, undergraduates, medical students, nursing students, residents, physicians, and local healthcare professionals through engaging hospital sessions at elementary schools. Collecting support from various organizations to collaborate for a culture of health within the community 3. Well-Being: By creating a fun and relaxed environment, we help children overcome anxieties about medical visits. Our activities promote healthy habits and instill confidence, paving the way for lifelong positive attitudes toward healthcare. Unique Value Proposition Teddy Bear Hospital DGSOM is unique in that it utilizes a play based approach to encourage children to be involved in their healthcare. We hope to use this approach to foster interest in health and higher education specifically in low SES areas in LA county. We also want to use this to teach medical students how to interact with pediatric patients. Structure Each of the following positions are eligible for self-nomination.

Teens for Screens at UCLA,"As part of efforts to come up with a new model for community outreach about breast cancer, UCSF's San Francisco Cancer Initiative Breast Cancer Task Force (SFCAN) discussed the idea of Teens for Screens (T4S) in 2018. In the course of numerous meetings and collaboration with community-based organizations geared toward the underserved population of San Francisco, the concept of creating a sustainable model of outreach to raise awareness of breast cancer among youth to educate their families and communities was developed. In addition to the support of SFCAN through the funding and resources they provided, the T4S pilot program would not have been possible without the leadership of Dr. Laura Fejerman, Dr. Ana Velasquez, Tania Dugatkin, and UCSF staff. We recognize them for the time, passion, support, and dedication they have contributed to T4S. In the Fall of 2019, T4S launched and empowered high school students with information to advocate for breast cancer screenings and healthy behaviors among their friends, families, and communities. In this vein, Teens for Screens at UCLA has adopted this model with a twist. To implement this model, UCLA Teens for Screens seeks to train undergraduate students as breast cancer educators to have them educate middle and high schoolers locally either in-person or remotely. As part of our outreach efforts, we aim to partner with high schools with high populations of underserved groups, such as low-income students and minorities, to provide them with information about breast cancer and the importance of screening. We also aim to provide one-on-one mentorship, with a culminating capstone project at the end of each program. As we continue this journey behind Teens for Screens, we hope that we can spread awareness about an often under-discussed, yet important issue.","Service - Outreach, Medical",[teensforscreensatucla@gmail.com](mailto:teensforscreensatucla@gmail.com),[https://teensforscreensucla.wixsite.com/teensforscreens](https://teensforscreensucla.wixsite.com/teensforscreens),,https://www.instagram.com/teens4screensatucla/,,,

"Bridge at UCLA is a workshop and mentorship based program that aims to bridge educational gaps for underprivileged high school students. Through our research on current educational support efforts, we discovered a generational gap between established programs and the high school students they serve. Although these efforts are still impactful, the support is not as relevant to the current day academic and career atmosphere, and the connection between mentors and mentees is less meaningful. This inspired us to create a university based program that runs off current students that have relevant experience in these areas. Bridge at UCLA aims to increase graduation rates through a mentorship program between collegiate students (at UCLA) and low-income students between the 10-12 grade range in local public schools. Our intent strays from increasing application turnout; instead, focusing on building strong professional skills to demonstrate career paths stemming from a high school diploma. As undergraduates with firsthand experience within higher education and the job market, our initiative is unique and relevant to high schools. On campus, we will recruit students through club fairs and departmental advertisements. We will search for students who are motivated to help youth, and train them to lead workshops and become one-on-one mentors. The workshops will be focused on a 5 stage curriculum of skill building, as outlined in the presented Journey Map, including: resumes, interviewing, college advising, scholarship opportunities, and academic tutoring. However, a major aspect of this program will be its emphasis on existing opportunities that are available to students looking to join the workforce, utilizing skillful development from our program. The mentorship program fosters meaningful connections between volunteers and students to provide personalized support for creating a future pathway, with emphasis on empowerment and student-led connection during the program. Thus, rather than serving several students at once per mentor, we will cater the experience to be more individualized and direct. We will approach this initiative by partnering with schools in LAUSD, specifically those in low-income regions. This will personalize our approach to the schools because we will better understand what the students need, learning from both staff and students.",Category:,,,,,,,,

"The Community College Field Biology Alliance will provide community college students from underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) the opportunity to experience scientific field work prior to transferring to a four-year university. Students will be mentored by graduate students from UCLA’s Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology through all stages of an independent scientific project; from development of methods, to data collection on the UC James San Jacinto Mountains Reserve one of the 39 field sites apart of the University of California Natural Reserve System, to the write up of a scientific poster. Further, it is our goal to foster meaningful relationships between the student interns and the graduate student mentors that will last beyond just completion of their project. This will be accomplished through weekly and monthly meetings and community oriented social events. Lastly, during the duration of the program students will also be exposed to workshops and information sessions aimed at assisting in the transferring process and building tangible knowledge of scientific methods that can be applied in their future undergraduate research and graduate studies. Our program structure is as follows: (1) Community College students interested in the natural sciences and conducting scientific research in the field will be invited to apply to this program. The program will run from April to August, culminating in a 10 day trip to the field to collect data and the completion of a poster in time for the UCLA Summer Poster Symposium. (2) Students will be paired with UCLA graduate students in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department whose field research interests most closely align with their own. Students will meet virtually with their mentors weekly and in person monthly. Students and their mentors will develop an independent observational field project that could feasibly be completed with ten days of data collection during the summer. (3)By the beginning of July, students will have completed a literature review and a methods protocol for their proposed field project. In late July, students and graduate mentors will travel to the James San Jacinto Mountains Reserve. This reserve is located approximately 2 hours from UCLA in the San Bernardino National Forest and is a part of the University of California Natural Reserve System.

Neurodiversity Health Chats at UCLA,"Neurodiversity Health Chats (NDHC) is originally a student led project (now club) led by Dr. Emily Hotez, Ph.D. and the UC-LEND clinic-- and funded by the Association of University Centers on Disabilities (AUCD)-- that seeks to improve the health and well-being of neurodivergent individuals through outreach and education. Since 2021, NDHC has improved access to resources and credible information for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD). NDHC is directly responsive to the well-established findings that neurodivergent populations have experienced disproportionate negative mental and physical health outcomes from the COVID-19 pandemic. NDHC applies a multi-pronged strategy to support neurodivergent populations. First, NDHC leverages social media to translate and disseminate valuable information on vaccination guidelines, needle anxieties, and barriers to vaccination. NDHC is highly adept at creating and disseminating plain language and accessible social media infographics through a range of channels, as well as conducting and sharing in-depth interviews with public health experts and individuals with lived experience. In addition to these outreach efforts, NDHC leads a portfolio of research. Last year, NDHC conducted a qualitative research study that analyzed key themes from interviews with medical and non-medical health professionals, communicators, and individuals with I/DD and their caregivers. Qualitative findings revealed that misinformation, vaccine risk perception, sensory sensitivities, and structural hardship were the most significant barriers to COVID-19 vaccination. In order to be responsive to the findings from our research study, NDHC embarked on the development and dissemination of a virtual CME/CE to promote vaccine confidence, access, and uptake in neurodivergent populations.","Medical, Service - Outreach",Website:,,,,,,

"The Science Lab Teaching Club was formed at UCLA Department of Physics and Astronomy in January 2012 under the scientific guidance of Dr. Konstantin Belov with several goals in mind, including: partially compensate the loss of the science teaching faculty at local public schools due to severe budget cuts; provide teaching experience for the undergraduate students majoring in physics and astronomy; spark interest in science in the next generation. The club members meet weekly during the school year to prepare lessons and practice lab demonstrations. The lessons on different STEM subjects are taught by the club members at local schools, catering to the interests of students of all age ranges. The emphasis is on teaching students in K-5 branches of physics such as electricity, magnetism, waves, and optics; however, we often branch out to other fields in STEM. Each lesson is accompanied by several spectacular demonstrations using the real laboratory equipment provided by the Department’s demo lab as well as presentations and additional demos designed and built by the club members. The club members strongly believe that in order to get children interested in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) subjects, science education should start at a very early age and each lesson should become a memorable experience for the kids. Club members have given presentations at the following schools: Norra Sterry Elementary School, Citizens of the World Mar Vista Charter School, Emerson Middle School, Palms Middle School, Fairburn Elementary School, Brentwood Science Magnet Elementary, and others. Undergraduate club member Nick Vincent has expressed his own enthusiasm for the program. ""The Science Teaching Club at UCLA gave me a great way to become involved in the community,"" said Nick. ""It encouraged me to use my passion for science to benefit local elementary schools. I think that my work with the Science Teaching Club has greatly augmented my education. The community service aspect has enriched my overall academic experience, the social aspect has allowed me to meet other physics students, and the cerebral challenge of designing quantum mechanics demonstrations for elementary school students truly engaged my mind.""",Category:,,,,,,,,

"TechUp at UCLA is a student-run organization with the sole mission of the advocacy of technology literacy within the local community. It is an extension of a local non-profit, TechUp Los Angeles. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been forced to shift to remote working and video meetings that require some tech literacy skills. Yet, people experiencing homelessness may not have access to the technology needed to grow these skills. Given the existing hardships and disadvantages in the job market, learning tech literacy skills would help increase the amount and types of jobs this population can apply for. This can also be applied to other populations that struggle with tech literacy skills such as people from low income areas, elderly adults, and those who are returning from incarceration. While growing in tech literacy cannot knock down every barrier, having basic tech literacy skills brings us one step closer to an inclusive job market. Today, TechUp LA has partnered with seven local organizations throughout LA County where we provide monthly workshops to individuals on the basics of smartphones and computers. Thus, TechUp at UCLA hopes to amplify TechUp LA’s mission at UCLA and offer volunteer opportunities to current students to knock down technology barriers for underserved communities together.",Category:,,,,,,,,

Teens for Screens at UCLA,"As part of efforts to come up with a new model for community outreach about breast cancer, UCSF's San Francisco Cancer Initiative Breast Cancer Task Force (SFCAN) discussed the idea of Teens for Screens (T4S) in 2018. In the course of numerous meetings and collaboration with community-based organizations geared toward the underserved population of San Francisco, the concept of creating a sustainable model of outreach to raise awareness of breast cancer among youth to educate their families and communities was developed. In addition to the support of SFCAN through the funding and resources they provided, the T4S pilot program would not have been possible without the leadership of Dr. Laura Fejerman, Dr. Ana Velasquez, Tania Dugatkin, and UCSF staff. We recognize them for the time, passion, support, and dedication they have contributed to T4S. In the Fall of 2019, T4S launched and empowered high school students with information to advocate for breast cancer screenings and healthy behaviors among their friends, families, and communities. In this vein, Teens for Screens at UCLA has adopted this model with a twist. To implement this model, UCLA Teens for Screens seeks to train undergraduate students as breast cancer educators to have them educate middle and high schoolers locally either in-person or remotely. As part of our outreach efforts, we aim to partner with high schools with high populations of underserved groups, such as low-income students and minorities, to provide them with information about breast cancer and the importance of screening. We also aim to provide one-on-one mentorship, with a culminating capstone project at the end of each program. As we continue this journey behind Teens for Screens, we hope that we can spread awareness about an often under-discussed, yet important issue.","Service - Outreach, Medical",Website:,,,,,,

American Institute of Chemical Engineers,"The American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) is a professional organization for chemical engineers. AIChE was established in 1908 with the purpose of establishing chemical engineers as a profession independent from chemists and mechanical engineers. The mission of the AIChE student chapter at UCLA is to promote excellence in the Chemical Engineering Department of the School of Engineering and Applied Science by providing resources and support to the undergraduate students so that they can succeed academically and advance professionally. AIChE's vision is to provide value as the global leader of the chemical engineering profession and be the lifetime center for professional and personal growth. In 1908 a small group of chemical engineers formed a professional society to promote and improve chemical engineering as a discipline. At first, the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) met with strong resistance, especially from the American Chemical Society (ACS), which claimed control over all pure and applied chemistry in the United States. In response, AIChE adopted a number of conservative measures, including strict membership criteria to keep membership low and avoid competition with ACS. Nonetheless, the value of AIChE was realized by the entire discipline in 1925, when chemical engineering became the first profession to use scholastic accreditation to ensure the consistency and quality of academic chemical engineering courses. The conservative attitude paid off when peace was made between ACS and AIChE around 1930. The membership criteria were lifted and chemical engineers joined in droves. Today AIChE remains the principal chemical engineering professional society in the United States. Currently about 57,000 (~70%) of American chemical engineers are members.","Engineering, Academic",Website:,,,,,,

Bruin Undergraduate Policy Review,"Bruin Undergraduate Policy Review (BUPR) is a nonpartisan undergraduate journal and policy institute at UCLA dedicated to promoting rigorous, evidence-based analysis of public policy. We are a student-run organization that empowers undergraduates to engage directly with pressing policy issues through research, writing, discussion, and professional development. BUPR provides a platform for students of all academic backgrounds and political perspectives to analyze public policy in depth, develop their voice as policy thinkers, and contribute to meaningful public dialogue. We believe that policy is at the heart of how society addresses its greatest challenges—whether it’s regulating artificial intelligence, reforming healthcare systems, reducing economic inequality, addressing climate change, or strengthening democratic institutions. Our mission is to help UCLA students not only understand these issues, but actively participate in the conversations that shape their outcomes. BUPR operates on three central pillars: 1. Publishing – Our online journal regularly publishes high-quality student-written articles and op-eds on a wide range of policy topics. Every article is edited collaboratively and held to high standards of evidence, clarity, and argumentation. Writers may choose to analyze existing legislation, examine the implications of a particular policy proposal, or compare different approaches to a societal challenge. We publish both analytical features and shorter, opinion-driven pieces—allowing students to explore a topic with depth or express a clear policy stance supported by research. 2. Legislative Newsletter – Each week, BUPR distributes a student-produced newsletter that highlights key legislative developments in various sectors, including technology, health, education, environment, and economic policy. Sector Leads track federal and state-level developments, summarize the core elements of proposed or passed bills, and offer brief context on their potential implications. The newsletter aims to help students stay informed about fast-moving policy landscapes in a concise, accessible format. 3. Speaker Events and Career Development – To connect academic inquiry with professional pathways, BUPR hosts speaker events featuring experts across the policy landscape. These include analysts from think tanks, government officials, attorneys, legislative staffers, nonprofit leaders, and others working at the intersection of policy and practice. Events are held either over Zoom or in person and are designed to expose students to a variety of career paths while creating opportunities to network with professionals in the field. We also plan resume-building workshops, internship panels, and career Q&As. Organizational Structure: BUPR is entirely student-led and structured to encourage collaboration and leadership development. The organization is overseen by an executive board consisting of the President, Vice President, Director of Publications, Treasurer, Director of Outreach, and a team of Sector Leads. Each Sector Lead manages a policy area (e.g., Economic Policy, Tech Policy, Health Policy), guides writers, and contributes to the weekly newsletter. Editors support writers through research help, feedback, and article development. We are proudly bipartisan and inclusive, providing space for a wide range of ideological perspectives—as long as arguments are grounded in evidence, respectful discourse, and a sincere interest in public policy. Our editorial standards prioritize analytical rigor, respectful debate, and intellectual humility. How to Get Involved: All UCLA undergraduate students are welcome to apply to join BUPR. We accept new members at the beginning of each quarter, though students may express interest at any time. Opportunities include becoming a: Staff Writer: Contribute 1–2 articles per quarter on topics of your choice, with support from Sector Leads and editors. Sector Lead: Manage a policy area, support writers, and compile weekly legislative updates. Editor: Work with writers to develop content and maintain publication quality. Outreach or Events Team Member: Help promote our work, recruit members, and organize speaker sessions We are especially excited to work with students who are passionate about policy but may not have formal writing experience—our editorial process is collaborative and designed to help students grow as thinkers and communicators.","Political, Educational",[elianabernstein@g.ucla.edu](mailto:elianabernstein@g.ucla.edu),,,https://www.instagram.com/bruinundergradpolicyreview?igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ%3D%3D&utm_source=qr,,,

Common Ground Collective,"Humanity is plagued by division. While diversity of ideas is crucial to any democratic system, our unwillingness to deliberate with those of varying opinions is creating a continuously enlarging rift that is becoming more problematic by the day. This rift is exacerbating society's issues and preventing action. From various backgrounds, beliefs, and positions, we unite here with the collective goal to alleviate society's communication gap: to move forward, we must find common ground. As a collective, we wish not to push specific beliefs or opinions; rather, we want to create and facilitate a safe space for communication between disagreeing groups, as this current environment is lacking at UCLA and in broader society. We first aim to set up a Public Forum for deliberation on various topics to achieve this goal. These forums aren't meant to decide a winner or which side is right. The purpose of these forums is for disagreeing groups to gain a better understanding of one another. A student moderator assigned by our club board will ensure discourse remains respectful and the goal of understanding is accomplished. The Public Forum is the only event we have committed to planning as of now, but we plan to branch out further into the UCLA community as the organization expands. All future events, regardless of what they may be, will always hold the same fundamental goals: to promote understanding, foster a safe environment for discourse, and find common ground while not negating the importance of varying views. Public Forums planned by the Common Ground Collective will always be open to all UCLA students and faculty.","Social Activism, Political",[CGCatUCLA@gmail.com](mailto:CGCatUCLA@gmail.com),[https://sites.google.com/view/cgcatucla/home](https://sites.google.com/view/cgcatucla/home),,https://www.instagram.com/cgc.ucla/,,,

OutWrite strives to build a growing educational platform through a multi-media approach that uplifts and empowers the often silenced voices of the incredibly diverse queer community. We aim to challenge dominant cisheteronormative narratives through an unapologetically anti-queerphobic, anti-racist, and progressive lens. OutWrite was established in 1979 under its original title TenPercent, becoming the first queer college publication in the country. The name TenPercent was chosen from the Alfred Kinsey’s study Sexual Behavior in the Human Male which stated that 10% of men identified as homosexual. In 2005, the newsmagazine’s staff petitioned to change the name to OutWrite to decenter the white, cis, gay male identity and use a name which better represents the queer community’s vast spectrum of identities. Throughout the years, the newsmagazine referred to itself as a ""gay and lesbian"" newsmagazine, slowly adding more identities to its moniker just as the mainstream community did in the late 20th century. Our label has since been changed to ""queer"" newsmagazine to recognize both the importance of inclusivity in our community and the inherent radical nature of our mission; queer is a verb and political statement as much as it is an umbrella descriptor encompassing the ever-growing LGBTQ+ acronym. OutWrite is proud to transform and adapt itself to better represent and serve queer people, changing its own identity as our community grows and changes.","Media, LGBTQI",[outwrite@media.ucla.edu](mailto:outwrite@media.ucla.edu),[https://linktr.ee/outwritenewsmag](https://linktr.ee/outwritenewsmag),https://facebook.com/outwritenewsmag,https://instagram.com/outwritenewsmag,https://twitter.com/outwritenewsmag,,

As QTPOC, we are already minorities in almost every space, but the legal field in particular highlights our lack of representation. The particular adversity we face allows very few of us to clear the hurdles of entry to this powerful institution.

"OutWrite Newsmagazine is the official queer newsmagazine of the University of California, Los Angeles. OutWrite strives to build a growing educational platform through a multi-media approach that uplifts and empowers the often silenced voices of the incredibly diverse queer community. We aim to challenge dominant cisheteronormative narratives through an unapologetically anti-queerphobic, anti-racist, and progressive lens. OutWrite was established in 1979 under its original title TenPercent, becoming the first queer college publication in the country. The name TenPercent was chosen from the Alfred Kinsey’s study Sexual Behavior in the Human Male which stated that 10% of men identified as homosexual. In 2005, the newsmagazine’s staff petitioned to change the name to OutWrite to decenter the white, cis, gay male identity and use a name which better represents the queer community’s vast spectrum of identities. Throughout the years, the newsmagazine referred to itself as a ""gay and lesbian"" newsmagazine, slowly adding more identities to its moniker just as the mainstream community did in the late 20th century. Our label has since been changed to ""queer"" newsmagazine to recognize both the importance of inclusivity in our community and the inherent radical nature of our mission; queer is a verb and political statement as much as it is an umbrella descriptor encompassing the ever-growing LGBTQ+ acronym. OutWrite is proud to transform and adapt itself to better represent and serve queer people, changing its own identity as our community grows and changes.",Category:,,,,,,,,

American Institute of Chemical Engineers,"The American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) is a professional organization for chemical engineers. AIChE was established in 1908 with the purpose of establishing chemical engineers as a profession independent from chemists and mechanical engineers. The mission of the AIChE student chapter at UCLA is to promote excellence in the Chemical Engineering Department of the School of Engineering and Applied Science by providing resources and support to the undergraduate students so that they can succeed academically and advance professionally. AIChE's vision is to provide value as the global leader of the chemical engineering profession and be the lifetime center for professional and personal growth. In 1908 a small group of chemical engineers formed a professional society to promote and improve chemical engineering as a discipline. At first, the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) met with strong resistance, especially from the American Chemical Society (ACS), which claimed control over all pure and applied chemistry in the United States. In response, AIChE adopted a number of conservative measures, including strict membership criteria to keep membership low and avoid competition with ACS. Nonetheless, the value of AIChE was realized by the entire discipline in 1925, when chemical engineering became the first profession to use scholastic accreditation to ensure the consistency and quality of academic chemical engineering courses. The conservative attitude paid off when peace was made between ACS and AIChE around 1930. The membership criteria were lifted and chemical engineers joined in droves. Today AIChE remains the principal chemical engineering professional society in the United States. Currently about 57,000 (~70%) of American chemical engineers are members.","Engineering, Academic",[president.aiche.ucla@gmail.com](mailto:president.aiche.ucla@gmail.com),[http://aiche.seas.ucla.edu/](http://aiche.seas.ucla.edu/),https://www.facebook.com/AIChEatUCLA,https://www.instagram.com/aicheatucla/,,,

"Gamma Zeta Alpha Fraternity, Inc.","In 1987, fifteen men came together to found what would later become known as Gamma Zeta Alpha Fraternity, Inc. -- Recognizing the difficulties facing Latinos in higher education, the founders sought to create an organization aimed at developing leadership, instilling academic scholarship, and creating an environment of support that integrated Latino heritage. After realizing that other student organizations would not be able to provide all of these to their members, the founders decided that creating a fraternity, something that was new in Latino culture, would be the best opportunity for achieving its goals. -- Our founders instilled in us the principles of Academic Excellence, through which we will encourage and support Latino males in higher education; Community Service, through which we will give back to the communities that shaped our lives; and the Maintenance of Latino Culture through Brotherhood in establishing the FIRST Latino-Based Organization on the West Coast. -- In 2000, when six gentlemen realized that other student organizations at UCLA would not be able to provide them with opportunities for personal growth, networking, and a chance to contribute meaningfully to both the UCLA campus and the surrounding community, they decided to establish a chapter of this fraternity to provide them the opportunity to achieve these goals. -- Eta Chapter prides itself on being established at the number one public university in the nation. Since it’s inception on January 15th, 2000, Eta Chapter has had a 99% graduation rate, leading to an extensive alumni network with brothers working in a range of professional fields from finance to city government, medicine, law, and everywhere in between. We are not members of this brotherhood for the short time that we are at UCLA; we are members of this brotherhood for a lifetime. -- At UCLA, we strive to uplift all our brothers and their respective communities. Having multiple brothers from diverse backgrounds, such as the undocumented, LGBTQ+, transfer, and other various historically underrepresented populations, gives us the opportunity to contribute to the betterment of each of these communities. Through a combination of brotherhood, service, and leadership development, the fraternity strives to create well-rounded individuals who are prepared to lead and inspire others to excel. -- Eta Chapter offers a supportive environment where individuals can cultivate lifelong friendships, engage in philanthropic endeavors, and participate in various social and educational activities. By upholding our core values, we play an essential role in enriching the campus community and empowering our members to make a positive impact in society. -- For more than two decades, Gamma Zeta Alpha Fraternity, Inc. at ETA Chapter has been cultivating leaders and strengthening the Latino community at UCLA.

National Black Law Journal,"UCLA-National Black Law Journal has been committed to scholarly discourse exploring the intersection of race and the law for thirty-five years. The NBLJ was started in 1970 by 5 African-American law students and 2 African-American law professors. The Journal was the first of its kind in the country. Because of the drop in African-American students at UCLA School of Law after the passage of proposition 209, the journal was sent to Columbia where publication could be continued. One of the Journals founding editors noted that it was important that there be a forum for providing a theoretical framework for practical daily application of Black legal ideas and concepts. The Journal has aimed to build on this tradition by publishing articles that make a substantive contribution to current dialogue taking place around issues such as affirmative action, employment law, the criminal justice system, community development and labor issues. The Journal has a commitment to publish articles that inspire new thought, explore new alternatives and contribute to current jurisprudential stances. In 2005, a group of students at UCLA began the process of bringing the journal back to its birthplace through the organization of a symposium entitled ""Regression Analysis: The Status of African Americans in American Legal Education."" In the Fall of 2009, a group of committed students reformed the NBLJ Board and in Spring 2010, NBLJ published at UCLA for the first time in over a decade.","Academic, African American",[nblj@lawnet.ucla.edu](mailto:nblj@lawnet.ucla.edu),,,,,,

This is a place where you can grapple with philosophical questions, and we can mutually work together to try to better our understanding of the world, our behavior within it, and whether or not we are justified in our beliefs. Whether you have only a budding interest in philosophy or if you are well versed in philosophical discourse, the club is a great way to expand your knowledge of the field and make friends along the way. WEEKLY MEETING Meetings are held every Tuesday at 6 pm in Dodd 399 (On Discord https://discord.gg/8YcZ3Uu during pandemics). During meetings, we discuss a specific philosophical issue for about an hour and a half. Topics are chosen and presented by any club members and often explore topics not commonly covered in undergraduate courses, e.g.: philosophy of progress, experience machine, and animal rights. We encourage you to present your own ideas! Sometimes we host philosophy-themed movie nights instead. We often go to Westwood for dinner after our weekly meetings to continue the discussion. MEDITATIONS PHILOSOPHY JOURNAL Meditations is the undergraduate journal of philosophy at UCLA. The purpose of the journal is to foster philosophical thought and provide an opportunity for undergraduates to gain writing and publishing experience. Maybe you have a philosophy paper that you’re really proud of, or you’re looking for a platform to test your arguments and be challenged. Maybe you have some cool ideas but hate writing when a grade depends on it. We encourage undergraduates of any major to participate in Meditations. BOOKCLUBS You can also be a part of our book club. The book club offers a chance to do a close reading of philosophical texts. During our weekly discussions, we will try to understand the ideas presented in the readings by breaking down nuances such as rhetoric and symbolism.

A Board of Directors, composed of psychologists who are Psi Chi members and who are elected by the chapters, guides the affairs of the organization and sets policy with the approval of the chapters. What are the Goals of Psi Chi? Psi Chi serves two major goals. The first of these is the Society’s obligation to provide academic recognition to its inductees by the mere fact of membership. The second goal is the obligation of each of the Society’s local chapters to nurture the spark of that accomplishment by offering a climate congenial to its creative development. For example, the chapters make active attempts to nourish and stimulate professional growth through programs designed to augment and enhance the regular curriculum and to provide practical experience and fellowship through affiliation with the chapter. In addition, the international organization provides programs to help achieve these goals, including Society and regional conventions held annually in conjunction with the psychological associations, research award competitions, and certificate recognition programs.","Honor Societies, Academic",[uclapsichi@gmail.com](mailto:uclapsichi@gmail.com),[https://uclapsichi.weebly.com/](https://uclapsichi.weebly.com/),,https://www.instagram.com/psichi_at_ucla/,,,

Student Stroke Team,"In 1992, recognizing the need for earlier detection and treatment of strokes, famed UCLA emergency room physician and neurologist Dr. Sidney Starkman gathered a fortunate group of UCLA undergraduate students and entrusted them with the responsibility to serve as the ""eyes and ears"" of the UCLA Stroke Network. Since its humble beginnings, the UCLA Stroke Program has split into two separate sister organizations: Student Stroke Team and Stroke Force. Both programs have expanded into well-ordered and effective student-operated organizations, each consisting of roughly 25 students rigorously chosen from UCLA's student body. Students in Student Stroke Team have the opportunity to experience neurorounds, which involve shadowing the Ronald Reagan Stroke Team on their morning rounds. On these neurorounds, students gain exposure to the field of stroke neurology, emergency medicine, and patient interaction.

National Black Law Journal,"UCLA-National Black Law Journal has been committed to scholarly discourse exploring the intersection of race and the law for thirty-five years. The NBLJ was started in 1970 by 5 African-American law students and 2 African-American law professors. The Journal was the first of its kind in the country. Because of the drop in African-American students at UCLA School of Law after the passage of proposition 209, the journal was sent to Columbia where publication could be continued. One of the Journals founding editors noted that it was important that there be a forum for providing a theoretical framework for practical daily application of Black legal ideas and concepts. The Journal has aimed to build on this tradition by publishing articles that make a substantive contribution to current dialogue taking place around issues such as affirmative action, employment law, the criminal justice system, community development and labor issues. The Journal has a commitment to publish articles that inspire new thought, explore new alternatives and contribute to current jurisprudential stances. In 2005, a group of students at UCLA began the process of bringing the journal back to its birthplace through the organization of a symposium entitled ""Regression Analysis: The Status of African Americans in American Legal Education.""

It is an extension of a local non-profit, TechUp Los Angeles. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been forced to shift to remote working and video meetings that require some tech literacy skills. Yet, people experiencing homelessness may not have access to the technology needed to grow these skills. Given the existing hardships and disadvantages in the job market, learning tech literacy skills would help increase the amount and types of jobs this population can apply for. This can also be applied to other populations that struggle with tech literacy skills such as people from low income areas, elderly adults, and those who are returning from incarceration. While growing in tech literacy cannot knock down every barrier, having basic tech literacy skills brings us one step closer to an inclusive job market. Today, TechUp LA has partnered with seven local organizations throughout LA County where we provide monthly workshops to individuals on the basics of smartphones and computers. Thus, TechUp at UCLA hopes to amplify TechUp LA’s mission at UCLA and offer volunteer opportunities to current students to knock down technology barriers for underserved communities together.","Service - Outreach, Technology",Website:,,,,,,

"The chief goal of the Philosophy Club is to provide a space for students to share and discuss ideas in an open-minded, friendly and respectful environment. This is a place where you can grapple with philosophical questions, and we can mutually work together to try to better our understanding of the world, our behavior within it, and whether or not we are justified in our beliefs. Whether you have only a budding interest in philosophy or if you are well versed in philosophical discourse, the club is a great way to expand your knowledge of the field and make friends along the way. WEEKLY MEETING Meetings are held every Tuesday at 6 pm in Dodd 399 (On Discord https://discord.gg/8YcZ3Uu during pandemics). During meetings, we discuss a specific philosophical issue for about an hour and a half. Topics are chosen and presented by any club members and often explore topics not commonly covered in undergraduate courses, e.g.: philosophy of progress, experience machine, and animal rights. We encourage you to present your own ideas! Sometimes we host philosophy-themed movie nights instead. We often go to Westwood for dinner after our weekly meetings to continue the discussion. MEDITATIONS PHILOSOPHY JOURNAL Meditations is the undergraduate journal of philosophy at UCLA. The purpose of the journal is to foster philosophical thought and provide an opportunity for undergraduates to gain writing and publishing experience. Maybe you have a philosophy paper that you’re really proud of, or you’re looking for a platform to test your arguments and be challenged. Maybe you have some cool ideas but hate writing when a grade depends on it. We encourage undergraduates of any major to participate in Meditations. BOOKCLUBS You can also be a part of our book club. The book club offers a chance to do a close reading of philosophical texts. During our weekly discussions, we will try to understand the ideas presented in the readings by breaking down nuances such as rhetoric and symbolism. OTHER PROGRAMS We encourage members to attend events organized by the Philosophy Department. We also cooperate with the department to plan events for you. For example coffee time with professors, study lounge, and information panel, and more. Facebook: Undergraduate Philosophy Club at UCLA",Category:,,,,,,,,

By improving our self esteem, we can focus less time on our physical appearance and more time on living our lives.

We also want to show how physical health affects mental health. We want to teach students ways to take care of their own health which will help them feel better. For instance we emphasize healthy eating and fitness, but encourage individuals to focus on feeling good rather than looking good. We want to make help accessible to those who are struggling with body dismorphia or eating disorders. Through our programming, we hope to educate the student body on these issues and how to tackle them. The Body Image Task Force also aims to help students learn how to handle college stress.

Everyday Responder Project @ UCLA,"According to a study conducted in 2017, the average EMS response time is about 6 minutes. However, this number was roughly doubled in rural settings, with nearly 1 in 10 encounters resulting in a wait time of over half an hour. When applying these metrics to some of the leading causes of death in the emergency prehospital setting (cardiac arrest and traumatic bleeding), an issue becomes apparent – time. The brain begins to suffer damage after roughly 4 minutes without oxygen and progresses toward irreversible damage after about 7 minutes. There are about half a million deaths from cardiac arrest in the U.S. every year, but a study conducted in 2009 revealed that, out of 138 bystanders who called 911 for a cardiac-related emergency, about half of the cardiac arrests were not detected. Similar patterns can be observed in bleeding emergencies, with over one-third of mortality from all traumatic injuries being attributed to severe hemorrhage and roughly 50% of hemorrhage-related deaths occurring before reaching a hospital. With most medical emergencies benefitting from immediate intervention, an effective approach to improving patient outcomes involves placing everyday people at the forefront of the medical care team. Understanding how to effectively engage the emergency response system and provide basic first aid (i.e. bleed control and CPR) can drastically improve a patient’s likelihood of survival. Previous research has highlighted the efficacy of bystander training programs in improving patient outcomes and increasing bystander confidence in providing medical aid: “Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) by laypersons (so-called bystanders) improves the chances of survival by a factor of 2-4” - Current Opinion in Critical Care (2015). “The proportion of students showing willingness to perform BLS increased from 13% to 77% after \[training\] even when the collapsed person is a stranger” — Resuscitation (2016). With the aim of improving accessibility to bystander medical training, the Everyday Responder Project (ERP) was founded in December 2020 by two students at the University of Southern California. The current ERP team consists of a variety of healthcare, educational, and creative professionals who are passionate about developing and teaching medical content. With the help of ERP’s volunteers, the organization has begun to pilot its core curriculum and work on larger, longitudinal projects that will help improve medical literacy and emergency preparedness in the various communities across California and beyond.","Health and Wellness, Educational",[srikarchintala@g.ucla.edu](mailto:srikarchintala@g.ucla.edu),[http://www.everydayresponderproject.org](http://www.everydayresponderproject.org/),,,,,

The Hidden Opponent x Sports Psychology Club,"The Hidden Opponent x Sports Psychology Club (THO x SPC) is designed to promote mental health to the student-athletes on campus. We would work hand in hand with the coaches and student-athletes to give them access to mental health resources that are designed specifically for student-athletes. Everyone undergoes stress at school, but there is a stigma surrounding student-athletes and how they manage their stress. With the stress of school on top of their sport, we could find ways to reduce the stressors in their lives, while giving them information and guidance about how they can value the importance of their mental health. We would provide student outreach programs specifically for the student-athletes that raise awareness about the importance of mental health. One example of this could be by bringing in a licensed clinical sports psychologist who is trained to work with professional athletes to campus, and hold a seminar for the student-athletes so they could learn from a professional. The main goal of this club is to provide positive mental health resources and spread awareness for this particular group of students, because sports psychology is very niche and overlooked. Hopefully, this club will serve as a way to positively incorporate mental health into the lives of student-athletes, and raise awareness for any mental health-related issues these students may be experiencing. We will also make this club extremely accessible for the student-athletes themselves, because we understand it is hard for these students to get involved in clubs on campus due to their busy schedules. We would do so by holding meetings on Google Meet as well as in-person, as that may be easier to fit into their busy schedules if they would like to join. We will also provide detailed notes and announcements via Google Classroom, Slack, and email. This way, if students do not have time to watch or attend meetings, they can stay in the loop and still be involved in the club to whatever capacity they can contribute. We will also definitely reach out to the coaches privately, and ask them if there are any specific things they think would be beneficial to help their student-athletes during the academic year. We would also love to administer a survey to all the student-athletes, where they could give us their anonymous opinions about things they are stressed about, so we could try to find ways to alleviate those stressors. We are also an official chapter of ""The Hidden Opponent"", a nationwide nonprofit organization that promotes mental health awareness for student-athletes across high school and college campuses. With this organization, we are able to provide resources and break the stigma on mental health in sports. We work with the NCAA and Club Sports Teams to host mental health awareness games, where we shine light on the importance of mental health with the help of a specific sports team.

UVP allows students the opportunity to volunteer at health fairs, giving them first-hand exposure to the health care field in one of the most underserved regions in the nation. Volunteers also help at the many events in which UMMA Clinic participates, including the Hawthorne Health Fair, Tax Day, Fremont Farmers Market, and Humanitarian Day. To further address the needs of the community, UVP is committed to providing preventative health education to students and patients in South Los Angeles. UVP has established weekly, after-school health and physical education courses at elementary and middle schools in South LA with the aim of promoting healthy living. As part of these courses, students are taught lessons on nutrition and the importance of healthy eating, as well as other health topics. Following each lesson plan are fun and interactive outdoor activities to get the students moving, with the ultimate goal of inspiring a lifelong enjoyment of physical activity. UVP also runs a weekly program for high schoolers in South LA where students learn about contemporary public health issues and present a capstone project on a topic of their choice. The program aims to develop students' research and critical thinking skills and inspire the next generation of leaders in healthcare. In addition to the youth, UVP also aims to educate the adult population of South Los Angeles about various health disorders through the Preventative Health Initiative (PHI). Every week, UVP volunteers spread awareness of initial warning signs, disease prevention, and healthy life-style practices while passing out free food and resources to UMMA Clinic patients and local community members at the Fremont Free Food Fair. These efforts are aimed to curb the prevalence of common health disorders including diabetes, hypertension, and other prevalent conditions. Due to the current pandemic, the Black and communities of color we serve are facing increased discrimination and lack of access to proper care or resources. With our connection to the UMMA Clinic we are hoping to address this prejudice in providing a health clinic that can provide for them without bias towards their race, income or zip code. Join us in making this change.","Health and Wellness, Medical",[umma.clinic.vol@gmail.com](mailto:umma.clinic.vol@gmail.com),[https://ummavp.weebly.com/](https://ummavp.weebly.com/),https://www.facebook.com/ummavolunteerproject,https://www.instagram.com/ummavolunteerproject/?hl=en,,,
