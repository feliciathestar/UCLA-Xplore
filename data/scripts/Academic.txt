AI Robotics Ethics Society

As technology advances at an exponential rate, it is imperative that we begin thinking about how Artificial Intelligence (AI) will impact society at different levels of daily life, with a focus on the ethical implications and implementation of AI systems. Notably, the development and involvement in AI ethics by students and professionals is nascent. The foresight of how important it is to regulate AI through the lens of ethical discussion and implementation is of paramount significance within the setting of the rapid development of AI and how it has already permeated of our daily lives. As such, the AI Robotics Ethics Society was founded in 2018 at UCLA by Aaron Hui to promote the awareness and importance of ethical implementation/regulation of AI. AIRES achieves its mission of ensuring AI is created both ethically and responsibly through a three-pronged approach: 1. To host a series of intra- and inter-departmental discussions at universities on AI and Robotics ethics. 2. To create a network and promote such awareness through hosting discussions and conferences with chapters of the AI Robotics Ethics Society. 3. To create a small lecture series on the latest breakthroughs and achievements in AI and Robotic ethics.

Aleph: Undergraduate Research Journal for the Humanities and Social Sciences

Aleph (pronounced “ah-lef”) is UCLA’s only official journal publishing undergraduate research in the humanities, social sciences, and behavioral sciences. Run by undergraduates who review submissions, Aleph publishes select submissions on-line, and in an annual “best of” print journal, with the support of our sponsor, the UCLA Undergraduate Research Center. Our goal is to disseminate a diverse group of papers that reflects the quality and breadth of undergraduate research at UCLA. Aleph offers an opportunity for motivated UCLA undergraduates to have their academic work published online and in print. By making UCLA’s undergraduate research available to a larger audience, we hope to broaden the impact and appeal of undergraduate research. As a student-run journal, Aleph provides all UCLA undergraduates the chance to join its staff and gain volunteer experience in publicizing, editing, and publishing.

American Institute of Chemical Engineers

The American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) is a professional organization for chemical engineers. AIChE was established in 1908 with the purpose of establishing chemical engineers as a profession independent from chemists and mechanical engineers. The mission of the AIChE student chapter at UCLA is to promote excellence in the Chemical Engineering Department of the School of Engineering and Applied Science by providing resources and support to the undergraduate students so that they can succeed academically and advance professionally. AIChE's vision is to provide value as the global leader of the chemical engineering profession and be the lifetime center for professional and personal growth. In 1908 a small group of chemical engineers formed a professional society to promote and improve chemical engineering as a discipline. At first, the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) met with strong resistance, especially from the American Chemical Society (ACS), which claimed control over all pure and applied chemistry in the United States. In response, AIChE adopted a number of conservative measures, including strict membership criteria to keep membership low and avoid competition with ACS. Nonetheless, the value of AIChE was realized by the entire discipline in 1925, when chemical engineering became the first profession to use scholastic accreditation to ensure the consistency and quality of academic chemical engineering courses. The conservative attitude paid off when peace was made between ACS and AIChE around 1930. The membership criteria were lifted and chemical engineers joined in droves. Today AIChE remains the principal chemical engineering professional society in the United States. Currently about 57,000 (~70%) of American chemical engineers are members.

Anesthesiology Student Interest Group (ASIG)

The Anesthesiology Interest Group at David Geffen School of Medicine aims to increase awareness and interest in Anesthesiology as it is a specialty that students have very little exposure to in the preclinical as well as in many students’ clinical years. It provides opportunities for students to learn about the specialty, become involved in research/mentorship/shadowing, and acquire hands-on practical skills with common procedures and techniques. We provide opportunities to attend anesthesia related workshops such as an airways lab to allow students to gain experience in intubating a patient and doing a cricothyroidotomy. We complete this mission through a variety of activities: -Airway management workshop co-hosted with other DGSOM student interest groups. Students are given a short introductory presentation on airway anatomy, followed by a hands-on workshop where students learn and practice intubation, as well as work with Glidescopes, fiber optic scopes, LMAs, and mask ventilation. -Pre-shadowing orientation in the Anesthesiology department at UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center. -Multiple interactive, case-based talks given by residents and professors of the Anesthesiology department at UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center.

Bruin Geolological Society

This is meant to be the ucla geology club. We want to enrich students' understanding and appreciation of rocks and earth processes outside of the classroom. In doing so, we hope to get more students involved in the Earth, Planetary, and Space Sciences, EPSS, here at UCLA. As such, the club is open to any current ucla graduate or undergraduate students. Additionally, we would like to take field trips, ideally once per quarter, that go off campus. This would allow our members to experience and learn about the diverse and dynamic geology of southern California. We are blessed with an environment that is very conducive to learning as we have vastly different types of rocks readily accessible within a few hours of UCLA.

Chi Epsilon, The Civil Engineering Honor Society

Dedicated to the purpose of maintaining and promoting the status of civil engineering as an ideal profession, Chi-Epsilon was organized to recognize the characteristics of the individual civil engineer deemed to be fundamental to the successful pursuit of an engineering career, and to aid in the development of those characteristics in the civil engineering student. Engineering, the application of scientific principles to the practical needs of society, is assuming a constantly increasing responsibility for the well-being of all people, and thus calling for competence of the highest order. This responsibility can be discharged only by a professional group whose members are possessed of a good basic technical ability, intelligence, moral integrity, and effective social poise in their relationship with the larger community of which they are part. To contribute to the improvement of the profession, Chi Epsilon fosters the development and exercise of sound traits of character and technical ability among civil engineers, and its members, by precept and example, toward an ever higher standard of professional service.

EPSS Family Mentorship Program (E.F.M.P)

The idea behind the EPSS Family Mentorship Program (EFMP) is to build a platform where students, from various stages of their undergraduate and graduate studies, can connect, share, and learn from each other on aspects such as, but not limited to, personal well-being, academic success, and professional development to work towards a socially cohesive and inclusive department. To make this possible, EFMP will work with (and complement) other student organizations such as EPSSSO, GeoLatinas, SGE, and SGEG.

Gamma Zeta Alpha Fraternity, Inc.

In 1987, fifteen men came together to found what would later become known as Gamma Zeta Alpha Fraternity, Inc. -- Recognizing the difficulties facing Latinos in higher education, the founders sought to create an organization aimed at developing leadership, instilling academic scholarship, and creating an environment of support that integrated Latino heritage. After realizing that other student organizations would not be able to provide all of these to their members, the founders decided that creating a fraternity, something that was new in Latino culture, would be the best opportunity for achieving its goals. -- Our founders instilled in us the principles of Academic Excellence, through which we will encourage and support Latino males in higher education; Community Service, through which we will give back to the communities that shaped our lives; and the Maintenance of Latino Culture through Brotherhood in establishing the FIRST Latino-Based Organization on the West Coast. -- In 2000, when six gentlemen realized that other student organizations at UCLA would not be able to provide them with opportunities for personal growth, networking, and a chance to contribute meaningfully to both the UCLA campus and the surrounding community, they decided to establish a chapter of this fraternity to provide them the opportunity to achieve these goals. -- Eta Chapter prides itself on being established at the number one public university in the nation. Since it’s inception on January 15th, 2000, Eta Chapter has had a 99% graduation rate, leading to an extensive alumni network with brothers working in a range of professional fields from finance to city government, medicine, law, and everywhere in between. We are not members of this brotherhood for the short time that we are at UCLA; we are members of this brotherhood for a lifetime. -- At UCLA, we strive to uplift all our brothers and their respective communities. Having multiple brothers from diverse backgrounds, such as the undocumented, LGBTQ+, transfer, and other various historically underrepresented populations, gives us the opportunity to contribute to the betterment of each of these communities. Through a combination of brotherhood, service, and leadership development, the fraternity strives to create well-rounded individuals who are prepared to lead and inspire others to excel. -- Eta Chapter offers a supportive environment where individuals can cultivate lifelong friendships, engage in philanthropic endeavors, and participate in various social and educational activities. By upholding our core values, we play an essential role in enriching the campus community and empowering our members to make a positive impact in society. -- For more than two decades, Gamma Zeta Alpha Fraternity, Inc. at ETA Chapter has been cultivating leaders and strengthening the Latino community at UCLA. As the LARGEST, and LONGEST-STANDING Latino-Based Organization, we will continue to produce sustainability that benefits our surrounding communities here at UCLA.

Honors Fellows at UCLA

The Honors Fellows is a vibrant, student-led organization within the UCLA College Honors program, dedicated to fostering a vibrant and supportive community among honors students. Our mission is to enhance the academic and professional development of our members while creating a welcoming and inclusive environment. We achieve this through a variety of initiatives, including academic and professional workshops tailored to the unique needs and interests of honors students. These workshops cover a wide range of topics, from research skills and thesis writing to career planning and networking strategies, providing valuable resources and guidance to help students excel in their studies and future endeavors. In addition to academic support, we place a strong emphasis on social engagement and community building. Our social events offer a fun and relaxed setting for honors students to connect, share experiences, and forge lasting friendships. These gatherings, ranging from informal meetups to larger celebrations, play a crucial role in creating a sense of belonging and camaraderie within the College Honors program. Recognizing the importance of accessible and personalized support, we also offer regular office hours. These sessions provide an opportunity for students to seek advice, ask questions, and discuss any challenges they may be facing with our experienced fellows. Whether it's academic concerns, personal issues, or just a friendly chat, our office hours are a valuable resource for students seeking guidance and support. Furthermore, as student ambassadors to the UCLA Honors Programs, we play a vital role in representing the interests and needs of honors students. We serve as a bridge between the student body and the program administration, advocating for policies and initiatives that enhance the honors experience. Our involvement in this capacity ensures that the voices of honors students are heard and that the program continues to evolve in ways that benefit its members. The Honors Fellows is more than just an organization; it's a community of motivated and ambitious individuals committed to supporting each other and making the most of their honors experience at UCLA. Through our academic and professional workshops, social events, office hours, and advocacy efforts, we strive to provide a comprehensive support system that empowers honors students to achieve their full potential and build meaningful connections within the College Honors program.

National Black Law Journal

UCLA-National Black Law Journal has been committed to scholarly discourse exploring the intersection of race and the law for thirty-five years. The NBLJ was started in 1970 by 5 African-American law students and 2 African-American law professors. The Journal was the first of its kind in the country. Because of the drop in African-American students at UCLA School of Law after the passage of proposition 209, the journal was sent to Columbia where publication could be continued. One of the Journals founding editors noted that it was important that there be a forum for providing a theoretical framework for practical daily application of Black legal ideas and concepts. The Journal has aimed to build on this tradition by publishing articles that make a substantive contribution to current dialogue taking place around issues such as affirmative action, employment law, the criminal justice system, community development and labor issues. The Journal has a commitment to publish articles that inspire new thought, explore new alternatives and contribute to current jurisprudential stances. In 2005, a group of students at UCLA began the process of bringing the journal back to its birthplace through the organization of a symposium entitled "Regression Analysis: The Status of African Americans in American Legal Education." In the Fall of 2009, a group of committed students reformed the NBLJ Board and in Spring 2010, NBLJ published at UCLA for the first time in over a decade.

National Student Data Corps at UCLA

NSDC @ UCLA provides a platform for students to learn data science/machine learning, connect with like-minded people, and explore possible data-related careers. We believe that there is currently a lack of data science resources and opportunities at UCLA for students new to the field; the existing data science clubs at UCLA are competitive and bar less experienced students from getting the resources they need. NSDC @ UCLA aims to bridge this gap by hosting projects, workshops, lectures, and community events catered toward newer students while also equipping more experienced students with career and developmental opportunities.

Philosophy Club at UCLA

The chief goal of the Philosophy Club is to provide a space for students to share and discuss ideas in an open-minded, friendly and respectful environment. This is a place where you can grapple with philosophical questions, and we can mutually work together to try to better our understanding of the world, our behavior within it, and whether or not we are justified in our beliefs. Whether you have only a budding interest in philosophy or if you are well versed in philosophical discourse, the club is a great way to expand your knowledge of the field and make friends along the way. WEEKLY MEETING Meetings are held every Tuesday at 6 pm in Dodd 399 (On Discord https://discord.gg/8YcZ3Uu during pandemics). During meetings, we discuss a specific philosophical issue for about an hour and a half. Topics are chosen and presented by any club members and often explore topics not commonly covered in undergraduate courses, e.g.: philosophy of progress, experience machine, and animal rights. We encourage you to present your own ideas! Sometimes we host philosophy-themed movie nights instead. We often go to Westwood for dinner after our weekly meetings to continue the discussion. MEDITATIONS PHILOSOPHY JOURNAL Meditations is the undergraduate journal of philosophy at UCLA. The purpose of the journal is to foster philosophical thought and provide an opportunity for undergraduates to gain writing and publishing experience. Maybe you have a philosophy paper that you’re really proud of, or you’re looking for a platform to test your arguments and be challenged. Maybe you have some cool ideas but hate writing when a grade depends on it. We encourage undergraduates of any major to participate in Meditations. BOOKCLUBS You can also be a part of our book club. The book club offers a chance to do a close reading of philosophical texts. During our weekly discussions, we will try to understand the ideas presented in the readings by breaking down nuances such as rhetoric and symbolism. OTHER PROGRAMS We encourage members to attend events organized by the Philosophy Department. We also cooperate with the department to plan events for you. For example coffee time with professors, study lounge, and information panel, and more. Facebook: Undergraduate Philosophy Club at UCLA

Pre-Med Undergraduate Mentorship Program (PUMP)

The Pre-Med Undergraduate Mentorship Program (PUMP) is a multifaceted organization that provides opportunities for leadership experience to upperclassmen through mentoring and program administration, as well as providing guidance and support to underclassmen pursuing a pre-med track. The goal of the program is to create a more inclusive environment by utilizing approachable undergraduate mentors and developing a more personal mentor-mentee relationship. There will be a certain number of mentees assigned to a single mentor that will be available to advise them during scheduled office hours that also serve as a study period. Approaching mentoring with low mentor to mentee ratios is what develops the close relationships, and employing undergraduates, who are more relatable than graduate students or professors, creates a more affable environment. Furthermore, we hope to form relationships with other health organizations to create a network for internship and research opportunities. Lastly, we hope to have guest speakers in the medical industry run workshops and speak about their professions.

Psi Chi International Honor Society in Psychology

What is Psi Chi? Psi Chi is the International Honor Society in Psychology, founded in 1929 for the purposes of encouraging, stimulating, and maintaining excellence in scholarship, and advancing the science of psychology. Membership is open to graduate and undergraduate men and women who are making the study of psychology one of their major interests, and who meet the minimum qualifications. Psi Chi is a member of the Association of College Honor Societies and is an affiliate of the American Psychological Association (APA) and the American Psychological Society (APS). Psi Chi functions as a federation of chapters located at over 1,000 senior colleges and universities in the USA and Canada. The Central Office is located in Chattanooga, Tennessee. A Board of Directors, composed of psychologists who are Psi Chi members and who are elected by the chapters, guides the affairs of the organization and sets policy with the approval of the chapters. What are the Goals of Psi Chi? Psi Chi serves two major goals. The first of these is the Society’s obligation to provide academic recognition to its inductees by the mere fact of membership. The second goal is the obligation of each of the Society’s local chapters to nurture the spark of that accomplishment by offering a climate congenial to its creative development. For example, the chapters make active attempts to nourish and stimulate professional growth through programs designed to augment and enhance the regular curriculum and to provide practical experience and fellowship through affiliation with the chapter. In addition, the international organization provides programs to help achieve these goals, including Society and regional conventions held annually in conjunction with the psychological associations, research award competitions, and certificate recognition programs.

It provides students with the opportunity to participate in a variety of speech events, each with its unique format and objectives. These events range from extemporaneous speaking to public speaking to interpretation speaking. The primary goal of the speech team is to help students develop confidence in their public speaking abilities and become effective communicators. Through regular practice, feedback from coaches and peers, and participation in competitive tournaments, students gain valuable skills in critical thinking, organization, and performance. Additionally, the speech team often fosters a sense of camaraderie and support among its members, creating a tight-knit community or “family” where students can encourage and learn from one another as they strive to reach their full potential on the stage.

Student Stroke Team

In 1992, recognizing the need for earlier detection and treatment of strokes, famed UCLA emergency room physician and neurologist Dr. Sidney Starkman gathered a fortunate group of UCLA undergraduate students and entrusted them with the responsibility to serve as the "eyes and ears" of the UCLA Stroke Network. Since its humble beginnings, the UCLA Stroke Program has split into two separate sister organizations: Student Stroke Team and Stroke Force. Both programs have expanded into well-ordered and effective student-operated organizations, each consisting of roughly 25 students rigorously chosen from UCLA's student body. Students in Student Stroke Team have the opportunity to experience neurorounds, which involve shadowing the Ronald Reagan Stroke Team on their morning rounds. On these neurorounds, students gain exposure to the field of stroke neurology, emergency medicine, and patient interaction. Members also participate in general meetings where they learn and present case studies and lessons about neurovasculature, imaging, the basics of clinical research, and current stroke clinical trials at UCLA. As research associates, students learn the basis for the investigation of new drugs and interventions in stroke, the pre-clinical research, the phases of trials, and the proper interpretation of the results obtained. In their tasks, students utilize their knowledge of the study hypothesis and methodology, patient selection criteria, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and rationale for the use of the drug procedure.

Underrepresented Graduate Students in Psychology

Underrepresented Graduate Students in Psychology (UGSP) is a group dedicated to supporting and advocating for psychology students from racial, linguistic, geographic, or socioeconomic backgrounds that are currently underrepresented in graduate education. UGSP is designed to provide valuable social support to these students whom may otherwise find it difficult to pursue their graduate studies. Through activities, mentorship, and community outreach, we hope to provide a community that encourages the potential and promise of those from underrepresented groups. By promoting and improving multicultural training in psychology, we hope to not only increase ethnic minority student recruitment, retention, and graduation but also improve intergroup relations within our department. UGSP operates with the following branches: UGSP Brown Bag Committee This committee organizes a lecture series that is open to all graduate students. These talks are given by faculty members and post-doctoral students from underrepresented backgrounds or whose research focuses on diversity issues. Each Brown Bag lecture includes both a research presentation and a career development component. This speaker series allows graduate students to network with prominent faculty members from underrepresented groups, hopefully fostering a sense social connectedness and community within the Psychology Department. UGSP Undergraduate Outreach Committee This committee organizes panels for undergraduate students to learn about various aspects of the graduate student experience. We hope to galvanize interest in graduate school by offering examples of successful underrepresented students from their own university. We also hope that this will provide undergraduates with the opportunity to connect with graduate students so they feel comfortable asking questions about diversity in graduate school. UGSP High School Outreach Committee As members of underrepresented groups, we find it imperative to give back to our communities through teaching, education, and service. UGSP will target high schools in low-income neighborhoods and will hold lectures for both parents and students about getting into college. UGSP Transfer Outreach Committee This committee is dedicated to providing resources and improving the experiences of the diverse group of transfer students at UCLA. A central goal of this committee is to serve transfers as they navigate their undergraduate experience and provide tools and information as they set future goals by creating/hosting events and building community between undergraduate and graduate students. UGSP Social Committee The Social Committee plans and coordinates various events each year, typically off campus. Our goal in organizing these events is to foster a sense of community among UGSP members. It is a chance for students to interact with people that come from diverse backgrounds who share similar experiences.

Youth Empowerment in Science (Y.E.S.) at UCLA

YES at UCLA is an organization inspiring the next generation of scientists through a team of highly motivated, undergraduate educators. Our ultimate vision is to show young students (3rd to 5th graders) that anyone, regardless of race, gender, or socioeconomic status, can find success in the field of science. We will fulfill this mission by holding science lessons at schools in the LA area. New members will be trained to work with children, contact schools of their choice, prepare small lectures, and ultimately lead clinics. Whether members need volunteer hours or simply want to help their community, YES will track their service throughout the year.
