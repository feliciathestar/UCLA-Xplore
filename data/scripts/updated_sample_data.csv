AI Robotics Ethics Society,"As technology advances at an exponential rate, it is imperative that we begin thinking about how Artificial Intelligence (AI) will impact society at different levels of daily life, with a focus on the ethical implications and implementation of AI systems. Notably, the development and involvement in AI ethics by students and professionals is nascent. The foresight of how important it is to regulate AI through the lens of ethical discussion and implementation is of paramount significance within the setting of the rapid development of AI and how it has already permeated of our daily lives. As such, the AI Robotics Ethics Society was founded in 2018 at UCLA by Aaron Hui to promote the awareness and importance of ethical implementation/regulation of AI. AIRES achieves its mission of ensuring AI is created both ethically and responsibly through a three-pronged approach: 1. To host a series of intra- and inter-departmental discussions at universities on AI and Robotics ethics. 2. To create a network and promote such awareness through hosting discussions and conferences with chapters of the AI Robotics Ethics Society. 3. To create a small lecture series on the latest breakthroughs and achievements in AI and Robotic ethics.","Academic, Journals",airesucla@gmail.com,https://airesucla8.wixsite.com/mysite,https://www.instagram.com/airesucla/,,,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-a-i-robotic-ethics-society/,,,,
