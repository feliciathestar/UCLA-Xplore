AAAA - Furries at UCLA

Furries at UCLA, or the Anthropomorphic Animal Appreciation Association, aims to bridge the larger furry community as a whole (fans of anthropomorphic animals) to the UCLA campus. Through education on topics related to, and community building centered around, the furry fandom, we aim to destigmatize the pop-culture reputation of furries.

Manual Dexterity for Charity

Manual dexterity is an important component in preparing for dental school and a contributing factor to dental school applications. However, many pre-dental students tend to overlook its importance or they simply have difficulties finding resources that allow them to develop manual dexterity skills in an enjoyable yet meaningful way. Thus, the purpose of this club is to allow more pre-dental students to come together to have fun while gaining manual dexterity skills through workshops involving activities such as crocheting, knitting, painting, etc. Arts and crafts made by members will be sold during fundraisers and all funds raised will go towards charitable causes.

Mirrorball Productions was founded when a group of theater students wanted to venture into film-land. A group of undergraduate students filled with a love for storytelling and creativity, banded together to form a production company. These students were inspired by a screenwriting course they took over the summer that became the inaugural short film, "Cedar Mountain." This company was created for students who have any interest in art to expand and enrich the craft of production and filmmaking to any degree. Mirrorball focuses on telling original stories, illuminating new perspectives of all-too-common narratives. The group aims to collaborate with the entire student body and anyone with a desire to create!

Planet Pose

Planet Pose aims to cultivate, inspire, motivate, and showcase UCLA's unique personal style of their student's everyday lives. POSE is dedicated to providing a world at UCLA for bold fashion enthusiasts to express themselves, discuss bizarre finds, and create together. You can share creations, have photoshoots, even perhaps a mini runway if you desire…anything can happen on our little planet. We heavily emphasize on inclusivity: if you are part of a marginalized group (POC, LGBTQ+, etc), POSE will be a space dedicated to making you feel included, listened, and seen. POSE emphasizes body neutrality over body positivity because not everyone can be in love with who they are but at least be comfortable in their own skin… or perhaps their own style.

In 2014 and 2016, the group qualified and performed for an audience of 10,000 at UCLA's Spring Sing, the university's largest, highly competitive musical showcase. In 2015, 2017, and 2018, Resonance competed in the Los Angeles A Cappella Festival (LAAF). In 2017, the group competed for the very first time at the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella (ICCA), placing 2nd at the Southwest Quarterfinal, 3rd at the Southwest Semifinal, and winning awards for Outstanding Arrangement at both competitions. In 2017, Resonance also recorded their first studio album, "In This Light", which is available now on iTunes and Spotify. Since then, singles "Bad Romance", "September", and "Praying Fools" have been released. In 2018 and 2020, Resonance competed in the ICCA once more, winning Outstanding Arrangement and placing 1st in the West Quarterfinals both years. In the year 2021, Resonance competed in the first virtual ICCA competition, placing 1st at both the West Quarterfinal and Semifinal, advancing them to finals.

The Giving Craft

Our club creates a space for individuals to craft and donate handmade items, including crochet, paintings, drawings, embroidery, felt art, and similar crafts, to healthcare facilities such as hospitals, clinics, and hospice care that cannot afford many decorations. Some hospitals may also not allow flowers in certain units or patients staying at inpatient facilities may not have visitors who could decorate their room/visit them often. However, research shows that various forms of art can improve patient outcomes and alleviate stress. By offering these handcrafted creations, we aim to provide comfort where traditional gifts like flowers are restricted. Additionally, the club promotes healthy hobbies and relaxation among students, fostering creativity while contributing to patient care and enhancing the environments of healthcare.
