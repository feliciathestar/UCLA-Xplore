AI Robotics Ethics Society,"As technology advances at an exponential rate, it is imperative that we begin thinking about how Artificial Intelligence (AI) will impact society at different levels of daily life, with a focus on the ethical implications and implementation of AI systems. Notably, the development and involvement in AI ethics by students and professionals is nascent. The foresight of how important it is to regulate AI through the lens of ethical discussion and implementation is of paramount significance within the setting of the rapid development of AI and how it has already permeated of our daily lives. As such, the AI Robotics Ethics Society was founded in 2018 at UCLA by Aaron Hui to promote the awareness and importance of ethical implementation/regulation of AI. AIRES achieves its mission of ensuring AI is created both ethically and responsibly through a three-pronged approach: 1. To host a series of intra- and inter-departmental discussions at universities on AI and Robotics ethics. 2. To create a network and promote such awareness through hosting discussions and conferences with chapters of the AI Robotics Ethics Society. 3. To create a small lecture series on the latest breakthroughs and achievements in AI and Robotic ethics.","Academic, Journals",[airesucla@gmail.com](mailto:airesucla@gmail.com),[https://airesucla8.wixsite.com/mysite](https://airesucla8.wixsite.com/mysite),,https://www.instagram.com/airesucla/,,,

American Institute of Chemical Engineers,"The American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) is a professional organization for chemical engineers. AIChE was established in 1908 with the purpose of establishing chemical engineers as a profession independent from chemists and mechanical engineers. The mission of the AIChE student chapter at UCLA is to promote excellence in the Chemical Engineering Department of the School of Engineering and Applied Science by providing resources and support to the undergraduate students so that they can succeed academically and advance professionally. AIChE's vision is to provide value as the global leader of the chemical engineering profession and be the lifetime center for professional and personal growth. In 1908 a small group of chemical engineers formed a professional society to promote and improve chemical engineering as a discipline. At first, the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) met with strong resistance, especially from the American Chemical Society (ACS), which claimed control over all pure and applied chemistry in the United States. In response, AIChE adopted a number of conservative measures, including strict membership criteria to keep membership low and avoid competition with ACS. Nonetheless, the value of AIChE was realized by the entire discipline in 1925, when chemical engineering became the first profession to use scholastic accreditation to ensure the consistency and quality of academic chemical engineering courses. The conservative attitude paid off when peace was made between ACS and AIChE around 1930. The membership criteria were lifted and chemical engineers joined in droves. Today AIChE remains the principal chemical engineering professional society in the United States. Currently about 57,000 (~70%) of American chemical engineers are members.","Engineering, Academic",[president.aiche.ucla@gmail.com](mailto:president.aiche.ucla@gmail.com),[http://aiche.seas.ucla.edu/](http://aiche.seas.ucla.edu/),https://www.facebook.com/AIChEatUCLA,https://www.instagram.com/aicheatucla/,,,

"Gamma Zeta Alpha Fraternity, Inc.","In 1987, fifteen men came together to found what would later become known as Gamma Zeta Alpha Fraternity, Inc. -- Recognizing the difficulties facing Latinos in higher education, the founders sought to create an organization aimed at developing leadership, instilling academic scholarship, and creating an environment of support that integrated Latino heritage. After realizing that other student organizations would not be able to provide all of these to their members, the founders decided that creating a fraternity, something that was new in Latino culture, would be the best opportunity for achieving its goals. -- Our founders instilled in us the principles of Academic Excellence, through which we will encourage and support Latino males in higher education; Community Service, through which we will give back to the communities that shaped our lives; and the Maintenance of Latino Culture through Brotherhood in establishing the FIRST Latino-Based Organization on the West Coast. -- In 2000, when six gentlemen realized that other student organizations at UCLA would not be able to provide them with opportunities for personal growth, networking, and a chance to contribute meaningfully to both the UCLA campus and the surrounding community, they decided to establish a chapter of this fraternity to provide them the opportunity to achieve these goals. -- Eta Chapter prides itself on being established at the number one public university in the nation. Since it’s inception on January 15th, 2000, Eta Chapter has had a 99% graduation rate, leading to an extensive alumni network with brothers working in a range of professional fields from finance to city government, medicine, law, and everywhere in between. We are not members of this brotherhood for the short time that we are at UCLA; we are members of this brotherhood for a lifetime. -- At UCLA, we strive to uplift all our brothers and their respective communities. Having multiple brothers from diverse backgrounds, such as the undocumented, LGBTQ+, transfer, and other various historically underrepresented populations, gives us the opportunity to contribute to the betterment of each of these communities. Through a combination of brotherhood, service, and leadership development, the fraternity strives to create well-rounded individuals who are prepared to lead and inspire others to excel. -- Eta Chapter offers a supportive environment where individuals can cultivate lifelong friendships, engage in philanthropic endeavors, and participate in various social and educational activities. By upholding our core values, we play an essential role in enriching the campus community and empowering our members to make a positive impact in society. -- For more than two decades, Gamma Zeta Alpha Fraternity, Inc. at ETA Chapter has been cultivating leaders and strengthening the Latino community at UCLA.

National Black Law Journal,"UCLA-National Black Law Journal has been committed to scholarly discourse exploring the intersection of race and the law for thirty-five years. The NBLJ was started in 1970 by 5 African-American law students and 2 African-American law professors. The Journal was the first of its kind in the country. Because of the drop in African-American students at UCLA School of Law after the passage of proposition 209, the journal was sent to Columbia where publication could be continued. One of the Journals founding editors noted that it was important that there be a forum for providing a theoretical framework for practical daily application of Black legal ideas and concepts. The Journal has aimed to build on this tradition by publishing articles that make a substantive contribution to current dialogue taking place around issues such as affirmative action, employment law, the criminal justice system, community development and labor issues. The Journal has a commitment to publish articles that inspire new thought, explore new alternatives and contribute to current jurisprudential stances. In 2005, a group of students at UCLA began the process of bringing the journal back to its birthplace through the organization of a symposium entitled ""Regression Analysis: The Status of African Americans in American Legal Education."" In the Fall of 2009, a group of committed students reformed the NBLJ Board and in Spring 2010, NBLJ published at UCLA for the first time in over a decade.","Academic, African American",[nblj@lawnet.ucla.edu](mailto:nblj@lawnet.ucla.edu),,,,,,

WEEKLY MEETING Meetings are held every Tuesday at 6 pm in Dodd 399 (On Discord https://discord.gg/8YcZ3Uu during pandemics). During meetings, we discuss a specific philosophical issue for about an hour and a half. Topics are chosen and presented by any club members and often explore topics not commonly covered in undergraduate courses, e.g.: philosophy of progress, experience machine, and animal rights. We encourage you to present your own ideas! Sometimes we host philosophy-themed movie nights instead. We often go to Westwood for dinner after our weekly meetings to continue the discussion. MEDITATIONS PHILOSOPHY JOURNAL Meditations is the undergraduate journal of philosophy at UCLA. The purpose of the journal is to foster philosophical thought and provide an opportunity for undergraduates to gain writing and publishing experience. Maybe you have a philosophy paper that you’re really proud of, or you’re looking for a platform to test your arguments and be challenged. Maybe you have some cool ideas but hate writing when a grade depends on it. We encourage undergraduates of any major to participate in Meditations. BOOKCLUBS You can also be a part of our book club. The book club offers a chance to do a close reading of philosophical texts. During our weekly discussions, we will try to understand the ideas presented in the readings by breaking down nuances such as rhetoric and symbolism.

The second goal is the obligation of each of the Society’s local chapters to nurture the spark of that accomplishment by offering a climate congenial to its creative development. For example, the chapters make active attempts to nourish and stimulate professional growth through programs designed to augment and enhance the regular curriculum and to provide practical experience and fellowship through affiliation with the chapter.

Student Stroke Team,"In 1992, recognizing the need for earlier detection and treatment of strokes, famed UCLA emergency room physician and neurologist Dr. Sidney Starkman gathered a fortunate group of UCLA undergraduate students and entrusted them with the responsibility to serve as the ""eyes and ears"" of the UCLA Stroke Network. Since its humble beginnings, the UCLA Stroke Program has split into two separate sister organizations: Student Stroke Team and Stroke Force. Both programs have expanded into well-ordered and effective student-operated organizations, each consisting of roughly 25 students rigorously chosen from UCLA's student body. Students in Student Stroke Team have the opportunity to experience neurorounds, which involve shadowing the Ronald Reagan Stroke Team on their morning rounds. On these neurorounds, students gain exposure to the field of stroke neurology, emergency medicine, and patient interaction. Members also participate in general meetings where they learn and present case studies and lessons about neurovasculature, imaging, the basics of clinical research, and current stroke clinical trials at UCLA. As research associates, students learn the basis for the investigation of new drugs and interventions in stroke, the pre-clinical research, the phases of trials, and the proper interpretation of the results obtained. In their tasks, students utilize their knowledge of the study hypothesis and methodology, patient selection criteria, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and rationale for the use of the drug procedure.","Medical, Academic",[sstcoords@gmail.com](mailto:sstcoords@gmail.com),[http://www.strokeprogram.org/](http://www.strokeprogram.org/),https://www.facebook.com/studentstroketeamatucla,https://www.instagram.com/uclastroketeam/,,,

These talks are given by faculty members and post-doctoral students from underrepresented backgrounds or whose research focuses on diversity issues. Each Brown Bag lecture includes both a research presentation and a career development component. This speaker series allows graduate students to network with prominent faculty members from underrepresented groups, hopefully fostering a sense social connectedness and community within the Psychology Department. UGSP Undergraduate Outreach Committee This committee organizes panels for undergraduate students to learn about various aspects of the graduate student experience. We hope to galvanize interest in graduate school by offering examples of successful underrepresented students from their own university. We also hope that this will provide undergraduates with the opportunity to connect with graduate students so they feel comfortable asking questions about diversity in graduate school. UGSP High School Outreach Committee As members of underrepresented groups, we find it imperative to give back to our communities through teaching, education, and service. UGSP will target high schools in low-income neighborhoods and will hold lectures for both parents and students about getting into college. UGSP Transfer Outreach Committee This committee is dedicated to providing resources and improving the experiences of the diverse group of transfer students at UCLA.

Because of the drop in African-American students at UCLA School of Law after the passage of proposition 209, the journal was sent to Columbia where publication could be continued. One of the Journals founding editors noted that it was important that there be a forum for providing a theoretical framework for practical daily application of Black legal ideas and concepts. The Journal has aimed to build on this tradition by publishing articles that make a substantive contribution to current dialogue taking place around issues such as affirmative action, employment law, the criminal justice system, community development and labor issues. The Journal has a commitment to publish articles that inspire new thought, explore new alternatives and contribute to current jurisprudential stances.

The Giving Craft,"Our club creates a space for individuals to craft and donate handmade items, including crochet, paintings, drawings, embroidery, felt art, and similar crafts, to healthcare facilities such as hospitals, clinics, and hospice care that cannot afford many decorations. Some hospitals may also not allow flowers in certain units or patients staying at inpatient facilities may not have visitors who could decorate their room/visit them often. However, research shows that various forms of art can improve patient outcomes and alleviate stress. By offering these handcrafted creations, we aim to provide comfort where traditional gifts like flowers are restricted. Additionally, the club promotes healthy hobbies and relaxation among students, fostering creativity while contributing to patient care and enhancing the environments of healthcare.","Arts, Medical",[thegivingcraft@gmail.com](mailto:thegivingcraft@gmail.com),,,,,,
