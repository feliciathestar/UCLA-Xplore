Dear Asian Youth @ UCLA

Dear Asian Youth is a literary magazine and non-profit organization that aims to empower, educate, and increase the political engagement of Asian individuals in the United States and beyond. As one of their 100+ chapters, DAY @ UCLA aims to educate our Bruin community using the same values of creativity and support. We aim to increase awareness of the issues that many Asians face as well as embolden Asians to feel proud of their heritage and culture. We believe that we can be a voice for APIDA individuals to promote Asian representation and push for more change in a world that does well to silence their narratives. We hope to inspire the APIDA community at UCLA and encourage cultural awareness throughout our campus.
