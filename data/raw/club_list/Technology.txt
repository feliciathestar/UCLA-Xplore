National Student Data Corps at UCLA

NSDC @ UCLA provides a platform for students to learn data science/machine learning, connect with like-minded people, and explore possible data-related careers. We believe that there is currently a lack of data science resources and opportunities at UCLA for students new to the field; the existing data science clubs at UCLA are competitive and bar less experienced students from getting the resources they need. NSDC @ UCLA aims to bridge this gap by hosting projects, workshops, lectures, and community events catered toward newer students while also equipping more experienced students with career and developmental opportunities.

TechUp at UCLA

TechUp at UCLA is a student-run organization with the sole mission of the advocacy of technology literacy within the local community. It is an extension of a local non-profit, TechUp Los Angeles. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been forced to shift to remote working and video meetings that require some tech literacy skills. Yet, people experiencing homelessness may not have access to the technology needed to grow these skills. Given the existing hardships and disadvantages in the job market, learning tech literacy skills would help increase the amount and types of jobs this population can apply for. This can also be applied to other populations that struggle with tech literacy skills such as people from low income areas, elderly adults, and those who are returning from incarceration. While growing in tech literacy cannot knock down every barrier, having basic tech literacy skills brings us one step closer to an inclusive job market. Today, TechUp LA has partnered with seven local organizations throughout LA County where we provide monthly workshops to individuals on the basics of smartphones and computers. Thus, TechUp at UCLA hopes to amplify TechUp LA’s mission at UCLA and offer volunteer opportunities to current students to knock down technology barriers for underserved communities together.

Ultrasound Interest Group (USIG)

The goal of the Ultrasound Interest Group (USIG) is to provide opportunities for medical students to receive a more expansive education in ultrasound that they can use during their medical training as well as their careers. Ultrasound is non-invasive, low cost imaging technique that when used appropriately has a high diagnostic power for many common conditions. As medicine moves to reduce unnecessary imaging studies and use safer and more cost effective imaging techniques, clinician performed and generalist ultrasound is becoming increasingly advocated.

Uncrewed Aerial Systems at UCLA (UAS@UCLA)

Uncrewed Aerial Systems is all about designing aerial robots. Specifically, our team of UCLA students designs, manufactures, and tests custom drones for accomplishing a series of mission objectives, for various research and competition purposes. UAS@UCLA complements the undergraduate engineering education at UCLA by offering the chance to gain hands-on experience on a complex engineering project. This project requires members to not only think outside the box of their major, but also learn collaboration and management skills through experience. Ultimately, UAS@UCLA is a big commitment, but the skills that are taught on the team directly apply to the professional environments you will experience in later jobs and internships. Finally, UAS@UCLA is a family, and the connections you make on the team can not only serve to further your professional career, but also give you support during and beyond your time in the undergraduate programs offered at UCLA. One of the main goals is to grow our club's culture and attract not only the best engineers to join our program, but also develop a diversified team with extensive collaboration opportunities among other teams at UCLA and internal career resources for leading members into their dream internship/job position in the STEM fields.
