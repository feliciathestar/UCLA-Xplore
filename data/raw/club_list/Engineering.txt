American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics at UCLA

AIAA is the world’s largest technical society dedicated to the global aerospace profession. Created in 1963 by the merger of the two great aerospace societies of the day, the American Rocket Society (founded in 1930 as the American Interplanetary Society), and the Institute of the Aerospace Sciences (established in 1933 as the Institute of the Aeronautical Sciences), AIAA carries forth a proud tradition of more than 80 years of aerospace leadership. AIAA currently has more than 240 student branches, including 40+ international student branches, with a total active membership of over 7,500 students worldwide. The UCLA student branch of AIAA will be your base of operations during your college years. Meet fellow students who share your passion and commitment to aerospace. Student branches foster opportunities for growth by allowing members to engage with real world engineering projects, networking with fellow students and faculty interested in aerospace, and providing professional development resources. AIAA at UCLA is home to four unique engineering student projects: Design Build Fly, Uncrewed Aerial Systems, Bruin Spacecraft Group, and Rocket Project.

American Institute of Chemical Engineers

The American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) is a professional organization for chemical engineers. AIChE was established in 1908 with the purpose of establishing chemical engineers as a profession independent from chemists and mechanical engineers. The mission of the AIChE student chapter at UCLA is to promote excellence in the Chemical Engineering Department of the School of Engineering and Applied Science by providing resources and support to the undergraduate students so that they can succeed academically and advance professionally. AIChE's vision is to provide value as the global leader of the chemical engineering profession and be the lifetime center for professional and personal growth. In 1908 a small group of chemical engineers formed a professional society to promote and improve chemical engineering as a discipline. At first, the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) met with strong resistance, especially from the American Chemical Society (ACS), which claimed control over all pure and applied chemistry in the United States. In response, AIChE adopted a number of conservative measures, including strict membership criteria to keep membership low and avoid competition with ACS. Nonetheless, the value of AIChE was realized by the entire discipline in 1925, when chemical engineering became the first profession to use scholastic accreditation to ensure the consistency and quality of academic chemical engineering courses. The conservative attitude paid off when peace was made between ACS and AIChE around 1930. The membership criteria were lifted and chemical engineers joined in droves. Today AIChE remains the principal chemical engineering professional society in the United States. Currently about 57,000 (~70%) of American chemical engineers are members.

American Society of Civil Engineers

The American Society of Engineers Student Chapter at UCLA (ASCE at UCLA) is a student run organization primarily interested in developing the young engineer with an emphasis in civil engineering. The organization competes in ten major design projects and two community service based project, and programs a wide variety of events including career fairs, professional development workshops, speakers, mentorship opportunities, field trips, intramural sports, and social functions. ASCE at UCLA consists of student members with a wide variety of backgrounds and academic levels, and often students from outside the major even join the group to take advantage of the many opportunities that ASCE membership can provide. The underlying goal of the student chapter's leadership team is to foster an environment that not only promotes engineering skills and professional development, but also helps to build the foundation for strong and enduring friendships for years to come. Since being chartered in 1959, UCLA's ASCE Student Chapter has grown into an active student-run organization that strives to promote the professional development of civil engineering students through curriculum-enriching activities.

Uncrewed Aerial Systems at UCLA (UAS@UCLA)

Uncrewed Aerial Systems is all about designing aerial robots. Specifically, our team of UCLA students designs, manufactures, and tests custom drones for accomplishing a series of mission objectives, for various research and competition purposes. UAS@UCLA complements the undergraduate engineering education at UCLA by offering the chance to gain hands-on experience on a complex engineering project. This project requires members to not only think outside the box of their major, but also learn collaboration and management skills through experience. Ultimately, UAS@UCLA is a big commitment, but the skills that are taught on the team directly apply to the professional environments you will experience in later jobs and internships. Finally, UAS@UCLA is a family, and the connections you make on the team can not only serve to further your professional career, but also give you support during and beyond your time in the undergraduate programs offered at UCLA. One of the main goals is to grow our club's culture and attract not only the best engineers to join our program, but also develop a diversified team with extensive collaboration opportunities among other teams at UCLA and internal career resources for leading members into their dream internship/job position in the STEM fields.
