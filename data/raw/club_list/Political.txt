American Indian Student Association

AISA stands as a welcoming association open to all UCLA students, although American Indians constitute less than 1% of the student body nationwide. We have cultivated a robust and supportive community that nurtures American Indian, Alaskan Native, and First Nation students in their educational pursuits at UCLA. Within the Native Bruin community, students unite to advance education and cultural understanding. Together, we challenge misconceptions surrounding American Indian art, language, history, and lifestyles. Our strength lies in our diverse backgrounds; every member enriches our community with unique perspectives, fostering a vibrant environment. At AISA, we've pioneered student-led outreach initiatives like American Indian Recruitment (AIR) and Retention of American Indians Now! (RAIN!), both headquartered in the Student Activities Center. These projects are tailored to empower Native individuals in their higher education journeys. We also host significant events annually, including Native American Heritage Week, the Youth Conference/Basketball Tournament, and the UCLA PowWow. Additionally, we pay homage to the Gabrieleño peoples, the original custodians of the Los Angeles Greater Basin and Southern Channel Islands, acknowledging their enduring connection to the land.

Anti Ableism Association at UCLA

We combat discriminatory issues by working collaboratively with other activists to fight current ableist legislation and strive for the cause to support the disabled community through grassroots level. This is accomplished through partnerships with disability organizations, reaching out to senators, hosting educational talks and workshops, and guiding individuals with disabilities on assistive technologies. We additionally expanded our focus to accessibility on campus, working with the CAE to ensure adequate accommodations and satisfactory processes for students in need and advocating to improve access to various parts on campus.

BridgeUSA at UCLA

BridgeUSA at UCLA is the UCLA chapter of BridgeUSA. BridgeUSA is a youth-led 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that creates spaces on high school and college campuses for open discussion between students about political issues. Political division is one of our biggest challenges in the United States. Today’s youth are being taught that tribalism is better than unity and that having conversations across our differences is impossible. Spoiler Alert: This isn’t true! We began in 2016 at the universities of Notre Dame, CU-Boulder, and UC Berkeley in response to growing polarization on campus. Our work emphasizes the importance of empathy and understanding, ideological diversity and solution-oriented politics. By engaging America’s youth in constructive discussions, we are equipping the next generation of leaders with the skills necessary for navigating conflict, finding solutions across differences and building bridges in their communities.

Bruin Undergraduate Policy Review

Bruin Undergraduate Policy Review (BUPR) is a nonpartisan undergraduate journal and policy institute at UCLA dedicated to promoting rigorous, evidence-based analysis of public policy. We are a student-run organization that empowers undergraduates to engage directly with pressing policy issues through research, writing, discussion, and professional development. BUPR provides a platform for students of all academic backgrounds and political perspectives to analyze public policy in depth, develop their voice as policy thinkers, and contribute to meaningful public dialogue. We believe that policy is at the heart of how society addresses its greatest challenges—whether it’s regulating artificial intelligence, reforming healthcare systems, reducing economic inequality, addressing climate change, or strengthening democratic institutions. Our mission is to help UCLA students not only understand these issues, but actively participate in the conversations that shape their outcomes. BUPR operates on three central pillars: 1. Publishing – Our online journal regularly publishes high-quality student-written articles and op-eds on a wide range of policy topics. Every article is edited collaboratively and held to high standards of evidence, clarity, and argumentation. Writers may choose to analyze existing legislation, examine the implications of a particular policy proposal, or compare different approaches to a societal challenge. We publish both analytical features and shorter, opinion-driven pieces—allowing students to explore a topic with depth or express a clear policy stance supported by research. 2. Legislative Newsletter – Each week, BUPR distributes a student-produced newsletter that highlights key legislative developments in various sectors, including technology, health, education, environment, and economic policy. Sector Leads track federal and state-level developments, summarize the core elements of proposed or passed bills, and offer brief context on their potential implications. The newsletter aims to help students stay informed about fast-moving policy landscapes in a concise, accessible format. 3. Speaker Events and Career Development – To connect academic inquiry with professional pathways, BUPR hosts speaker events featuring experts across the policy landscape. These include analysts from think tanks, government officials, attorneys, legislative staffers, nonprofit leaders, and others working at the intersection of policy and practice. Events are held either over Zoom or in person and are designed to expose students to a variety of career paths while creating opportunities to network with professionals in the field. We also plan resume-building workshops, internship panels, and career Q&As. Organizational Structure: BUPR is entirely student-led and structured to encourage collaboration and leadership development. The organization is overseen by an executive board consisting of the President, Vice President, Director of Publications, Treasurer, Director of Outreach, and a team of Sector Leads. Each Sector Lead manages a policy area (e.g., Economic Policy, Tech Policy, Health Policy), guides writers, and contributes to the weekly newsletter. Editors support writers through research help, feedback, and article development. We are proudly bipartisan and inclusive, providing space for a wide range of ideological perspectives—as long as arguments are grounded in evidence, respectful discourse, and a sincere interest in public policy. Our editorial standards prioritize analytical rigor, respectful debate, and intellectual humility. How to Get Involved: All UCLA undergraduate students are welcome to apply to join BUPR. We accept new members at the beginning of each quarter, though students may express interest at any time. Opportunities include becoming a: Staff Writer: Contribute 1–2 articles per quarter on topics of your choice, with support from Sector Leads and editors. Sector Lead: Manage a policy area, support writers, and compile weekly legislative updates. Editor: Work with writers to develop content and maintain publication quality. Outreach or Events Team Member: Help promote our work, recruit members, and organize speaker sessions We are especially excited to work with students who are passionate about policy but may not have formal writing experience—our editorial process is collaborative and designed to help students grow as thinkers and communicators.

Common Ground Collective

Humanity is plagued by division. While diversity of ideas is crucial to any democratic system, our unwillingness to deliberate with those of varying opinions is creating a continuously enlarging rift that is becoming more problematic by the day. This rift is exacerbating society's issues and preventing action. From various backgrounds, beliefs, and positions, we unite here with the collective goal to alleviate society's communication gap: to move forward, we must find common ground. As a collective, we wish not to push specific beliefs or opinions; rather, we want to create and facilitate a safe space for communication between disagreeing groups, as this current environment is lacking at UCLA and in broader society. We first aim to set up a Public Forum for deliberation on various topics to achieve this goal. These forums aren't meant to decide a winner or which side is right. The purpose of these forums is for disagreeing groups to gain a better understanding of one another. A student moderator assigned by our club board will ensure discourse remains respectful and the goal of understanding is accomplished. The Public Forum is the only event we have committed to planning as of now, but we plan to branch out further into the UCLA community as the organization expands. All future events, regardless of what they may be, will always hold the same fundamental goals: to promote understanding, foster a safe environment for discourse, and find common ground while not negating the importance of varying views. Public Forums planned by the Common Ground Collective will always be open to all UCLA students and faculty.

Students For Socialism

Students For Socialism is the student affiliate of the Party for Socialism and Liberation, a national organization involved in a wide range of struggles, from local battles over affordable housing and racist police brutality, to global issues of imperialist war and environmental destruction. SFS continues this tradition and attempts to merge the struggles of oppressed and exploited people with the fight for socialism. We are united in our belief that capitalism—a system where all wealth and power is held by a small group of billionaires and their state—is the source of the main problems confronting humanity today. It must be replaced by socialism, a system where poor and working people control all the wealth and power of society, using it to plan for and meet the needs of the people and planet.

Young Democratic Socialists of America at UCLA

Young Democratic Socialists of America is the youth and student section of the Democratic Socialists of America, and a national organization of recognized campus chapters and several hundred activists. We are students organizing in our universities, colleges, and high schools to fight for the immediate needs of workers and students while building our capacity to fight for more radical and structural changes. YDSA fights for democratic socialism through active campaigns that challenge capitalist exploitation and oppression. We support organized labor by joining picket lines and joining unions. We organize to defend immigrants through campaigns for sanctuary campuses. We engage in strategic electoral work with candidates who will fight for the working class. We campaign to divest our schools from fossil fuels. We do anti-poverty work through local mutual aid programs in our communities, and much much more. We also provide peer-led political education and organizer training programs to sharpen our skills and analysis. The Democratic Socialists of America is the largest socialist organization in the United States. We believe that working people should run both the economy and society democratically to meet human needs, not to make profits for a few.
