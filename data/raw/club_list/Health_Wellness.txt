Throughout the academic year, we will host tabling events, canvass in the greater Los Angeles area, present at community centers, and hold Q&A panels with clinicians in underserved neighborhoods. We will also build community through social events, ensuring connection while working together to propel change.

Building Heroes Project at UCLA

Building Heroes aims to educate the underserved community about medical emergencies. Club members will learn to lead participants through hands on skill training designed to give them the means to help control medical emergencies before EMS arrives. Club members will also help participants understand when something is a medical emergency and when they should seek help. Each site we visit will also be provided with a list of contacts for medical and psychological help within their immediate area. Besides the hands on style skills training, we will also offer free Red Cross Adult and Pediatric First Aid/CPR/AED certification to any participants seeking official certification. In addition to community outreach, this club also aims to collect data from the underserved community and participate in a longitudinal research study. Club members will create surveys and collect data before and after visiting sites. The study will focus on participants experience with medical emergencies, their level of preparedness, and their willingness to help. Lastly, we want to work on creating first aid kits tailored to the homeless and underserved communities. These will be handed out to all participants who complete our program. Through Building Heroes, club members will gain a deeper understanding of first aid techniques, and learn how to lead hands on discussions and lectures. In addition, they will gain important field research experience. Perhaps most rewarding, club members will be given the chance to make a difference in the underserved community by sharing life saving knowledge.

Companion Care

Companion Care (CC)'s mission is to build sustainable bridges between people experiencing homelessness and healthcare services in Los Angeles. To achieve this end, CC partners with the Mobile Clinic Project at UCLA (MCP) to offer clients accompanied and/or unaccompanied primary care appointments to Wesley Health Center. CC’s client base is composed of individuals who are ready to seek primary care services, but who face structural and interpersonal barriers to care such as medical mistrust, language barriers, and chronic conditions that cannot be addressed in an acute healthcare setting. Through the practice of accompaniment, a practice that prioritizes the client’s voice and lived-experience in their healthcare journey, companions serve as partners for clients re-entering the traditional healthcare setting. When a client chooses an accompanied appointment, they attend with a companion whose role is to facilitate a sense of felt safety, comfort, and agency for the client. Practically, accompaniment entails filling out paperwork, communicating long-term goals, and arranging transportation, in addition to tackling any other barriers between clients and the services that they deserve. CC’s ultimate goal is to make healthcare an equitable resource through solidarity, humility, and partnership.

Donation of Tissues and Organs (DotOrg)

DoT Org at UCLA together with Latinx/Chicanx for Community Medicine (LCCM) began as a student initiated effort to educate and increase consciousness within UCLA students and members of the surrounding communities concerning the myths and facts of organ and tissue donation. We hope to dispel common misconceptions and thus increase the pool of registered donors within the Los Angeles area. Our goal is to raise consciousness of organ and tissue donation through on and off campus events, which include the annual Donate Life Run/Walk, Give Life, Give Thanks donor drive, etc. With the collective effort of our volunteers, we hope to reach the community through public health fairs, pre-health conferences, LAUSD high school site visits, and other community-based sites in Los Angeles County.

Everyday Responder Project @ UCLA

According to a study conducted in 2017, the average EMS response time is about 6 minutes. However, this number was roughly doubled in rural settings, with nearly 1 in 10 encounters resulting in a wait time of over half an hour. When applying these metrics to some of the leading causes of death in the emergency prehospital setting (cardiac arrest and traumatic bleeding), an issue becomes apparent – time. The brain begins to suffer damage after roughly 4 minutes without oxygen and progresses toward irreversible damage after about 7 minutes. There are about half a million deaths from cardiac arrest in the U.S. every year, but a study conducted in 2009 revealed that, out of 138 bystanders who called 911 for a cardiac-related emergency, about half of the cardiac arrests were not detected. Similar patterns can be observed in bleeding emergencies, with over one-third of mortality from all traumatic injuries being attributed to severe hemorrhage and roughly 50% of hemorrhage-related deaths occurring before reaching a hospital. With most medical emergencies benefitting from immediate intervention, an effective approach to improving patient outcomes involves placing everyday people at the forefront of the medical care team. Understanding how to effectively engage the emergency response system and provide basic first aid (i.e. bleed control and CPR) can drastically improve a patient’s likelihood of survival. Previous research has highlighted the efficacy of bystander training programs in improving patient outcomes and increasing bystander confidence in providing medical aid: “Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) by laypersons (so-called bystanders) improves the chances of survival by a factor of 2-4” - Current Opinion in Critical Care (2015). “The proportion of students showing willingness to perform BLS increased from 13% to 77% after \[training\] even when the collapsed person is a stranger” — Resuscitation (2016). With the aim of improving accessibility to bystander medical training, the Everyday Responder Project (ERP) was founded in December 2020 by two students at the University of Southern California. The current ERP team consists of a variety of healthcare, educational, and creative professionals who are passionate about developing and teaching medical content. With the help of ERP’s volunteers, the organization has begun to pilot its core curriculum and work on larger, longitudinal projects that will help improve medical literacy and emergency preparedness in the various communities across California and beyond.

Health Law Society

The mission of the Health Law Society (HLS) is to raise the profile of health law issues at the school and to provide exposure to the field and opportunities for students interested in studying and pursuing careers in health law. Healthcare is a highly regulated industry, and with the new health reform bill, the law concerning healthcare is growing and changing. This means that health law is an exciting area of study as well as a great field for lawyers to enter into. Reflecting this trend, UCLA has been adding to its health law curriculum with courses offered by Professor Hoffman in Health Insurance Reform and Health Law and Policy. We would like to supplement this curriculum by bringing in experts to discuss various components of health law and enlighten students on relevant issues. We will also strive to enhance the employment prospects for students interested in health law by bringing potential employers to network with students. HLS will heighten the profile of UCLA as an attractive choice for prospective students in health law and will strengthen connections between the school and the legal community.

I AM CONFIDENT RESILIENCE PEER EMPOWERMENT\*

I AM Confident Resilience Peer Empowerment (CRPE). The heart and soul of confidence, resilience, and empowerment Our journey is not just about words on a page; it’s a profound commitment to transforming lives through the incredible power of self-belief, inner strength, and community support. At CRPE, our mission is clear: we are here to ignite the flame of confidence and resilience within every individual.

ICHI Volunteer Association

The ICHI Volunteer Association is a student-run club that serves to provide volunteers for partner non-profit organizations. Volunteers work as clinic assistants, fundraising delegates, and nutritional assistance providers. The purpose of the volunteer’s association is to create opportunities for UCLA students who wish to receive experience in a clinical setting to volunteer for partner non-profit organizations. Our goal is to establish opportunities for UCLA students to reach out to the underserved communities in Los Angeles and abroad by providing clinical and social services; where people of all backgrounds who are unable to afford medical services can have access to high-quality medical care without revealing private information. We strive to provide “Services for the Community, By the Community” in order to empower the communities we serve. We do this by recruiting members from within the communities we serve, working with organizations in the area, and asking people from within the community about their most pressing needs via surveys and interviews. We operate as a group of student volunteers and are not a business or non-profit organization.

Lifestyle Medicine Interest Group

Lifestyle Medicine is one of the fastest growing career fields of medicine globally. Holding the promise for health reform as it addresses the root-cause of chronic illness, Lifestyle Medicine is the evidence-based practice of helping individuals and families adopt and sustain healthy behaviors that affect health and quality of life. Examples of target patient behaviors include, but are not limited to, eliminating tobacco use, improving diet, increasing physical activity, and moderating alcohol consumption. Medical students across the country have expressed concerns about the lack of lifestyle medicine knowledge surrounding topics such as physical activity, nutrition, and behavior-change strategies. The aspiration of Lifestyle Medicine Interest Group (LMIG) at DGSOM is to equip students with the knowledge and skills necessary to counsel patients about exercise, diet, behavior change, and preventative medicine, taking into account positive psychology and the social determinants of health. The goals of LMIG are to: - Educate students about how to address lifestyle-based management of chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, celiac disease, and obesity. - Train students regarding how to provide accurate and helpful Lifestyle Medicine counseling to patients and make targeted recommendations for patients that would fit their budget, life-style and other socio-economic determinants. - Enrich students’ knowledge about exercise, diet and nutrition, behavior change, positive psychology and wellness coaching, and the power of preventative medicine. - Help students gain confidence when speaking to patients about lifestyle-based health behaviors and offer personalized advice that is accurate and evidence-based. The focus of lunch and learn lectures, presentations, workshops, and participation in community health fairs is not only to educate students about lifestyle medicine and chronic illnesses such as diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity, but to help them integrate the experience that they will acquire in clinical settings and beyond. Members of LMIG will become registered members of the American College of Lifestyle Medicine (ACLM) which will provide evidence-based Lifestyle Medicine training as the first treatment option in clinical practice through live and online CME-accredited events and educational offerings, certification, clinical practice tools, patient education resources, economic research, networking opportunities, national conferences and advocacy efforts.

Muscular Dystrophy Society at DGSOM

Muscular dystrophies (MD) are a genetically and clinically diverse group of rare muscle disorders that lead to the progressive weakening and breakdown of skeletal muscles. With nine types of MD, all characterized by eventual loss of strength and mobility, individuals affected by these conditions face increasing disability and potential deformities. Although there is no cure, ongoing research and treatments provide hope for managing symptoms and improving quality of life. The aim is to empower students to go beyond the classroom and engage in political advocacy and leadership. In partnership with the Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA), we focus not only on muscular dystrophies but also on a wide range of neuromuscular disorders. By working together, we aim to shape healthcare policy and advocate for better patient care and research funding for these rare and often underrepresented diseases. Our mission centers on raising awareness of neuromuscular disorders within the medical and broader communities, while providing students with hands-on opportunities to explore careers in medicine. Through collaboration with national medical organizations and attendance at conferences, students can build professional networks and participate in meaningful discussions around the future of healthcare. These experiences will equip future healthcare leaders with the skills necessary to drive change in both patient care and medical research. Working closely with the MDA to engage in political advocacy at the local, state, and national levels. We advocate for policies that promote funding for neuromuscular disease research, support patient access to cutting-edge treatments, and raise the profile of these rare diseases within the healthcare system. By involving medical students in these efforts, we aim to foster a new generation of physicians who are not only skilled clinicians but also leaders in healthcare policy and patient advocacy. In addition to advocacy, our organization supports opportunities to learn more about MDS and other neuromuscular issues from talented faculty at UCLA involved in research. By partnering with UCLA Health physicians students will gain valuable insights into the challenges and advancements in the treatment of neuromuscular diseases. These efforts will allow students to see firsthand the importance of research in shaping the future of healthcare and improving patient outcomes. By creating a network of student advocates for neuromuscular health, we hope to build a movement dedicated to improving the lives of individuals with neuromuscular diseases. Through leadership, advocacy, and education, the Muscular Dystrophy Society and Neuromuscular Illness Club will work to make a lasting impact on the future of medicine.

Muscular dystrophies are a genetically and clinically heterogeneous group of rare muscle disorders that progressively weaken and breakdown of skeletal muscles over time. There are 9 types of muscular dystrophy, with each type involving an eventual loss of strength, increased disability, and possible deformity. There's currently no cure for muscular dystrophy (MD), but a variety of treatments can help to manage the condition. As different types of MD can cause quite specific problems, the treatment one receives will be tailored to their specific needs. As a member of Muscular Dystrophy Society on Campus (MDS), we aim to raise funds, do volunteer work, and donate to research facilities specialized in MD. We further aim to spread awareness of MD through partnering with the Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA), and bringing to light related neuromuscular diseases in the greater UCLA community. We hope to be able to spread our mission to campuses across the nation and educate students worldwide about MD.

Project Lux

Project Lux is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to bridging the gap between healthcare and houselessness. One of the ways we accomplish this is through directly assisting individuals experiencing houselessness access health insurance. By becoming Certified Enrollment Counselors (CECs) through Covered California, members enroll unhoused clients into programs such as Medi-Cal at a variety of different shelters/organizations on a weekly basis. Our current sites include the Skid Row Community Refresh Spot and the Westwood Public Library. We also assemble care packages with food/water and other basic necessities, distributing them directly to the unhoused community. At our enrollment fairs, we provide additional resources including referrals to nearby clinics in which members can point clients towards the care that they need. Moreover, we provide bus passes to make traveling to clinics and other resources more accessible. Lastly, we focus on advocacy, curating useful resources, and calling for change at a higher level. We hope that this multifaceted approach to aiding the unhoused community will help us create a ripple of change.

Psychiatry Interest Group

The Psychiatry Interest Group is dedicated to helping its members explore the field of psychiatry and its many subspecialties. Through lunch talks, skills workshops, outings into the community, and easily accessible information about the field, we hope to not only educate, but to expand the student body's interest in the practice of psychiatry. We consider mentorship to be a necessary aspect of exploring a career path, and will facilitate mentorship relationships with practicing residents and psychiatrists in the community. These relationships will allow open communication that will enable students to learn more about the lifestyle, day-to-day practice, and training process of psychiatry. This group will provide opportunities for leadership to all its members. Members will not only have the opportunity to become the interest group's leaders, but may also hold roles coordinating mentorship and group events. The Psychiatry Interest Group at UCLA will continue to be a part of the Psychiatry Student Interest Group Network (PsychSIGN), a nationwide network of medical students interested in this field. Being a part of this network offers our members connections to peers, residents, and practicing psychiatrists all over the country.

The healthcare paradigm we support is one that is characterized not only by disease treatment and prevention, but also by interprofessionalism, health promotion, and person-oriented care. SIM encourages students to be aware of our current medical system, methods of self-care, and healing ideologies across cultures. We also provide a forum to learn, experience, share, and explore topics in Integrative Medicine (IM) such as nutrition, mind-body medicine, research, and healthcare. We aim to build a community of students interested in these topics and to connect them with networks of professionals in their respective fields.

SWC Body Image Task Force

The aim of the Body Image Task Force is to help the entire UCLA student body combat issues of body image. We do so by hosting events, workshops, and speakers that tackle issues such as exercise, eating disorders, body dysmorphia, mental health, and self esteem. Living as college students in Los Angeles, we want to help students understand how influenced we all are by media images and we want to give students the tools to combat these influences. The media has given us a specific image of what is beautiful, and we want to encourage every student on campus to feel confident and beautiful no matter how their body looks. By improving our self esteem, we can focus less time on our physical appearance and more time on living our lives. We hope to enhance the self esteem of students by demonstrating beauty isn’t only skin-deep, and by pushing students to be positive with themselves and not to be so critical. We also want to show how physical health affects mental health. We want to teach students ways to take care of their own health which will help them feel better. For instance we emphasize healthy eating and fitness, but encourage individuals to focus on feeling good rather than looking good. We want to make help accessible to those who are struggling with body dismorphia or eating disorders. Through our programming, we hope to educate the student body on these issues and how to tackle them. The Body Image Task Force also aims to help students learn how to handle college stress. We hope to provide stress outlets because we believe that mental health is also connected to self esteem and in general happiness. As students, we all face a variety of obstacles that can ultimately hold us back. We hope to reduce these personal barriers to help each student here reach their full potential.

SWC Student Education and Research of Contemporary Health

SEARCH: Student Education and Research on Contemporary Health—our name says it all. We know that there is a lot of research out there on health issues that are currently plaguing college students, but we want to cater out research and solutions specifically for the UCLA student body. Being a college student requires juggling academics, extra-curricular activities, work, friends, and family among a myriad of other things. Sometimes the health of the student gets pushed in the backseat in order to deal with these tasks, and students become sleep-deprived, consume energy drinks, abuse academic performance enhancement drug, and much, much more. Our goal is to find research studies and conduct our own research about healthy living styles and healthy alternatives to common choices and to disseminate this research to the UCLA student body so we can arm them with the tools they need to make the decisions that are best for them not only now, but also for the future.

With the stress of school on top of their sport, we could find ways to reduce the stressors in their lives, while giving them information and guidance about how they can value the importance of their mental health. We would provide student outreach programs specifically for the student-athletes that raise awareness about the importance of mental health. One example of this could be by bringing in a licensed clinical sports psychologist who is trained to work with professional athletes to campus, and hold a seminar for the student-athletes so they could learn from a professional. The main goal of this club is to provide positive mental health resources and spread awareness for this particular group of students, because sports psychology is very niche and overlooked. Hopefully, this club will serve as a way to positively incorporate mental health into the lives of student-athletes, and raise awareness for any mental health-related issues these students may be experiencing. We will also make this club extremely accessible for the student-athletes themselves, because we understand it is hard for these students to get involved in clubs on campus due to their busy schedules. We would do so by holding meetings on Google Meet as well as in-person, as that may be easier to fit into their busy schedules if they would like to join. We will also provide detailed notes and announcements via Google Classroom, Slack, and email. This way, if students do not have time to watch or attend meetings, they can stay in the loop and still be involved in the club to whatever capacity they can contribute. We will also definitely reach out to the coaches privately, and ask them if there are any specific things they think would be beneficial to help their student-athletes during the academic year. We would also love to administer a survey to all the student-athletes, where they could give us their anonymous opinions about things they are stressed about, so we could try to find ways to alleviate those stressors. We are also an official chapter of "The Hidden Opponent", a nationwide nonprofit organization that promotes mental health awareness for student-athletes across high school and college campuses. With this organization, we are able to provide resources and break the stigma on mental health in sports. We work with the NCAA and Club Sports Teams to host mental health awareness games, where we shine light on the importance of mental health with the help of a specific sports team. Working with "The Hidden Opponent" is an amazing way to promote mental health awareness in sports to student-athletes, as well as any student who either partakes in a sport on or off campus, or has a passion for mental health in the sports industry.

UMMA Volunteer Project (UVP)

UMMA Volunteer Project (UVP) was founded in 1996 as a volunteer source for the UMMA Community Clinic, a free health clinic established by UCLA graduate and undergraduate students to serve the residents of the South Los Angeles community. Since its opening, UMMA Clinic has served over 30,000 patients, 90% of whom are below the poverty line. UVP has been assisting UMMA Clinic since it's inception and played a crucial role in the clinic's early success by providing a steady group of volunteers to assist at the clinic. UVP allows students the opportunity to volunteer at health fairs, giving them first-hand exposure to the health care field in one of the most underserved regions in the nation. Volunteers also help at the many events in which UMMA Clinic participates, including the Hawthorne Health Fair, Tax Day, Fremont Farmers Market, and Humanitarian Day. To further address the needs of the community, UVP is committed to providing preventative health education to students and patients in South Los Angeles. UVP has established weekly, after-school health and physical education courses at elementary and middle schools in South LA with the aim of promoting healthy living. As part of these courses, students are taught lessons on nutrition and the importance of healthy eating, as well as other health topics. Following each lesson plan are fun and interactive outdoor activities to get the students moving, with the ultimate goal of inspiring a lifelong enjoyment of physical activity. UVP also runs a weekly program for high schoolers in South LA where students learn about contemporary public health issues and present a capstone project on a topic of their choice. The program aims to develop students' research and critical thinking skills and inspire the next generation of leaders in healthcare. In addition to the youth, UVP also aims to educate the adult population of South Los Angeles about various health disorders through the Preventative Health Initiative (PHI). Every week, UVP volunteers spread awareness of initial warning signs, disease prevention, and healthy life-style practices while passing out free food and resources to UMMA Clinic patients and local community members at the Fremont Free Food Fair. These efforts are aimed to curb the prevalence of common health disorders including diabetes, hypertension, and other prevalent conditions. Due to the current pandemic, the Black and communities of color we serve are facing increased discrimination and lack of access to proper care or resources. With our connection to the UMMA Clinic we are hoping to address this prejudice in providing a health clinic that can provide for them without bias towards their race, income or zip code. Join us in making this change.

Vietnamese Community Health Project at UCLA

Vietnamese Community Health aspires to address the issue of preventative health through education, free services, and screenings in the Orange County and greater Los Angeles area. We attempt to accomplish this in three ways: promoting awareness of prevalent health issues affecting low-income families with minimal access to healthcare in southern California; ensuring the growth and expansion of community health by informing and empowering the volunteers and general UCLA members through education and awareness; and collaborating with other health projects from UCLA and the Vietnamese Community of southern California to provide services and host events that would benefit the Vietnamese and other socio-economically disadvantaged communities. Volunteers work with health professionals, build leadership in health-related community service, interact with patients, become educated on predominant community health issues, and have workshops to help make them strong leaders in the health field and community. VCH members will be provided with numerous opportunities for community service, leadership development, and mentorship opportunities. Community service opportunities include quarterly VCH-sponsored health fairs, biweekly health sites, and participation at community health fairs sponsored by non-profit organizations that VCH partners with. In addition, there is a leadership development "internship" offered each winter quarter. In the program, interns learn about the challenges and rewards that VCH staff members face when making decisions and working collaboratively in a group environment. Interns get the opportunity to apply for a position on VCH staff, as well as a Committee Head; nonetheless, the skills gained from the internship are easily applicable to any other leadership and management position.
