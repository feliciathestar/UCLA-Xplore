American Constitution Society

The American Constitution Society for Law and Policy (ACS) is one of the nation's leading progressive legal organizations. Founded in 2001, ACS is a rapidly growing network of lawyers, law students, scholars, judges, policymakers and other concerned individuals. Our mission is to promote the vitality of the U.S. Constitution and the fundamental values it expresses: individual rights and liberties, genuine equality, access to justice, democracy and the rule of law. We are revitalizing and transforming legal and policy debates in classrooms, courtrooms, legislatures and the media, and we are building a diverse and dynamic network of progressives committed to justice. UCLA's ACS chapter is the most active student organization on campus. We are comprised of law students committed to building a broad community around a progressive vision of law and policy. Throughout the year, we hold substantive events on issues ranging from immigrants' rights and criminal justice to constitutional interpretation. We also hold social events throughout the year to connect students with faculty and practitioners and with each other.

Artistic Activism Coalition

The Artistic Activism Coalition at UCLA is a student organization working to educate and mobilize the community in addressing and advocating for topics that are crucial in our society today. Our mission is to give the students of UCLA a safe space to discuss and learn about various topics relating to social justice and activism, where they can use their artistic skills and passion as an vehicle for social awareness and change. The organization is all-inclusive, looking for people who are passionate about creating, learning, and advocacy. Members of this organisation would use various forms of visual and performing arts to discuss and learn about issues related to social justice and activism, and to spread awareness on topics they’re most passionate about. We aim to partner with different organizations on campus that share our vision, so as to provide our members with resources that allow them to remain informed and educated whilst also expanding their portfolio! Our Executive Board will be trained in Artistic Activism under the CAA (Center for Artistic Activism) to broaden the horizon of this organization and provide new, useful resources for its members and the community. We believe that art is empowering, stimulating, and timeless— that it fosters empathy and understanding. We aim to create a bridge between art and activism, using it as an effective tool to make a significant difference to our community.

Association of Indonesian Americans

Founded in 2020, the Association of Indonesian Americans is an organization for Indonesian-Americans, people of Indonesian descent, and people who are interested in the political, social, cultural, or educational aspects of the Indonesian-American community in the United States. This organization was formed out of a need to create a space for a group that is historically underrepresented in many facets of American society. As members of the Association of Indonesian Americans, we feel that it is our duty to not only learn and interpret Indonesian and Indonesian-American history and culture, but to empower Indonesian-Americans and members of this organization by uniting and supporting the Indonesian-American community through political advocacy, social interactions, cultural awareness, education, and outreach.

Autism Advocacy at UCLA

Autism Advocacy at UCLA was founded in hopes of providing resources for students to connect and come together to help spread knowledge about autism, educate our peers, and serve those on our campus and in our community. Through fundraising events, volunteering, and various advocacy projects and efforts, we educate students and faculty members on how they are able to make a difference and empower the Autism community in the Los Angeles area. Our goal is to foster an environment of understanding of those on the spectrum and to emphasize learning about Autism from those on the spectrum’s experiences rather than merely “raising awareness” of Autism.

California Public Interest Research Group

CALPIRG is a statewide, student directed, public interest advocacy organization and is funded through student fees. Our organizers and advocates train students on how to run effective campaigns to solve some of society's most urgent issues through policy. Our primary mission is to encourage student power and activism and to serve as a resource to all student organizations. Last year we had several significant accomplishments. We were the group that passed SB100, one of the strongest climate change laws in the country which committed the entire state of CA to 100% clean electricity by 2045. And in the 2018 election, CALPIRG students across the state registered 6,000 students to vote and contacted 500,000 students to get them to the polls. Read more about our accomplishments here: https://calpirgstudents.org/recent-victories/ If you are a part of or affiliated with a student group that would like to collaborate or seek assistance from CALPIRG, please email our organizer or chapter leadership directly! We are excited about the upcoming quarter, and encourage all interested students to apply for an internship. Join our chapter and you will gain skills and experience necessary to make a difference in the world, as well as meet an amazing group of intelligent, positive, and hardworking people. (We also have a LOT of fun doing it!!)

Common Ground Collective

Humanity is plagued by division. While diversity of ideas is crucial to any democratic system, our unwillingness to deliberate with those of varying opinions is creating a continuously enlarging rift that is becoming more problematic by the day. This rift is exacerbating society's issues and preventing action. From various backgrounds, beliefs, and positions, we unite here with the collective goal to alleviate society's communication gap: to move forward, we must find common ground. As a collective, we wish not to push specific beliefs or opinions; rather, we want to create and facilitate a safe space for communication between disagreeing groups, as this current environment is lacking at UCLA and in broader society. We first aim to set up a Public Forum for deliberation on various topics to achieve this goal. These forums aren't meant to decide a winner or which side is right. The purpose of these forums is for disagreeing groups to gain a better understanding of one another. A student moderator assigned by our club board will ensure discourse remains respectful and the goal of understanding is accomplished. The Public Forum is the only event we have committed to planning as of now, but we plan to branch out further into the UCLA community as the organization expands. All future events, regardless of what they may be, will always hold the same fundamental goals: to promote understanding, foster a safe environment for discourse, and find common ground while not negating the importance of varying views. Public Forums planned by the Common Ground Collective will always be open to all UCLA students and faculty.

Dear Asian Youth @ UCLA

Dear Asian Youth is a literary magazine and non-profit organization that aims to empower, educate, and increase the political engagement of Asian individuals in the United States and beyond. As one of their 100+ chapters, DAY @ UCLA aims to educate our Bruin community using the same values of creativity and support. We aim to increase awareness of the issues that many Asians face as well as embolden Asians to feel proud of their heritage and culture. We believe that we can be a voice for APIDA individuals to promote Asian representation and push for more change in a world that does well to silence their narratives. We hope to inspire the APIDA community at UCLA and encourage cultural awareness throughout our campus.

We host weekly workshops revolving around these topics, and encourage members to use their experiences to enact changes in their everyday lives. These "Dig-ins" are usually held every Sunday from 12-2. Sign up for the email list on our website to find out more on how to join us in the garden!

Genocide Relief, Awareness, and Community Education (GRACE)

The Genocide Relief, Awareness, and Community Education (GRACE) Organization is committed to preventing, addressing, and seeking justice for all forms of mass atrocities targeting ethnic and religious groups. In a world desensitized by digital media, GRACE attempts to combat the widespread ignorance of genocides by organizing events featuring speakers, survivors, and experts to share their stories and educate UCLA students. Each month, the organization will focus on a specific genocide, dedicating the month to lectures and presentations that explore the culture of the affected group, the nature of the genocide, and the pursuit of justice. Additionally, GRACE will promote donation efforts, educational resources, and petitions. While we recognize that such initiatives cannot resolve the larger issues at play, fostering a passionate student-led community is a crucial step that GRACE undertakes toward addressing the inaction perpetuating genocides worldwide.

Habitat for Humanity is an international nonprofit organization founded to help alleviate housing insecurity by building affordable homes and strong, safe, and stable communities. Our UCLA chapter works with Habitat for Humanity Greater Los Angeles and Homes4Families to help create these communities around the LA area, targeting the homeless veteran demographic. We help homeless/housing insecure veterans by organizing biweekly build days that consist of traveling to a ‘build site’ where UCLA student volunteers will assist in tasks essential to forming the neighborhood. These various tasks include installing windows, digging pipeline trenches, and even mixing and pouring concrete. We also help at Habitat Re:Stores where we help sort donations of furniture and supplies from individuals and companies to sell to the public at a fraction of the retail price. Thus, diverting reusable household items from landfills, and further funding Habitat construction projects.

Health Equity in Nursing (HEN)

This organization focuses on promoting health equity within nursing. We aim to explore topics such as, but not limited to: anti-racism, culturally-humble care, social and structural determinants of health, trauma-informed care, and health disparities among marginalized populations. Our goal is to facilitate discussions and events centering on the impact of these intersecting issues on community health, thereby fostering intrapersonal, interpersonal, and collective growth among UCLA nursing students and within the UCLA community overall. We believe that, as healthcare providers serving diverse populations, it is of utmost importance that we better understand how societal injustices are rooted deeply in a historical context and are continuously reproduced to the detriment of achieving health equity for marginalized groups. It is our duty as student nurses to provide the best possible care to those we serve. In order to achieve this aim, we must learn to address our own internal biases and understand relevant historical and cultural context in order to advocate for our patients. We also want to think critically about how nurses, and other healthcare professionals, have been complicit in these systems of injustice throughout history, and how we can instead use our positions to dismantle these inequities. Ultimately, we envision a future healthcare system that is more just and more equitable, and we aim to play a role in its creation.

iYTP was formed in 1988 as part of the MSA (Muslim Student Association) to provide incarcerated juveniles with the opportunity to become productive members of society by accommodating these youth who have most fallen victim to depraved circumstances via mentoring, tutoring, and counseling services. iYTP focuses on encouraging incarcerated juveniles to pursue a secondary education through a curriculum based GED tutoring, and on decreasing recidivism rates by counseling and mentoring students in developing and reevaluating their life trajectories. We take privileged students, like you, from UCLA (and abroad) to Camp Gonzales in Malibu to tutor, mentor, and counsel these underprivileged students. We also work with Felicitas and Gonzalo Mendez High School in Boyle Heights to tutor and mentor at-risk students. The goal of this tutoring is to help these students receive their high school diploma opening the doors to more educational opportunities.

LSIJ believes that every person in this country—regardless of when or how they arrived here; the crimes they have been charged with or convicted of; their race, ethnicity, skin color, sexual orientation or gender identity; and their educational background or military service—deserves to live free from deportation, prison, and police violence on land stolen from Indigenous peoples.

Magical Moments Foundation at UCLA

Magical Moments Foundation is a wish-granting organization for children with craniofacial disorders. We work to make a difference in these children’s lives, spread awareness of the lifelong harm caused by appearance-related stigma, and promote acceptance of facial diversity. Children with facial differences often endure the pain of teasing, bullying, and isolation— pain that can leave emotional scars that last a lifetime. Children that face the world with a difference also endure the challenge of a more silent, but just as damaging, form of stigma: that of unconscious bias. And so, many children with differences grow up in a world that tells them that their dreams must be smaller than those of their peers. Magical Moments is working to change all of that. We create magical experiences that restore hope and provide comfort, inspiration, and encouragement to children with facial differences that are the result of genetic disorders, congenital anomalies, cancer treatment, severe trauma and burns. We help children understand that they are not at all limited by their appearance, but only by the size of their dreams! Through the magical moments that we create, we not only make a difference in children’s lives, but we also promote awareness of the lifelong harm caused by appearance-related stigma and create more widespread acceptance of facial diversity within our communities. As an organization, we grant wishes that teach children with facial differences to believe in themselves while teaching the world to see and celebrate the beauty in every child!

Pediatric AIDS Coalition

The Pediatric AIDS Coalition (PAC) at UCLA seeks to unify our diverse student population through education, action, and fundraising for an AIDS-free generation. PAC is one of the largest student-run nonprofits on the West Coast, and we have held our annual Dance Marathon (DM) since 2002. The goal of DM is to involve the UCLA campus community in the fight against Pediatric HIV/AIDS by raising funds and awareness to end mother-to-child transmission. We provide HIV education, work to end stigma, celebrate our collective power, and articulate our community’s role in the future of this fight. DM has become an iconic event within the UCLA community, so much that it's considered a “True Bruin Tradition.” Since its founding, PAC has raised over $6 million for our beneficiaries: The Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, The Laurel Foundation, and the UCLA AIDS Institute. In addition to planning and participating in DM, members of PAC participate in promotional events, fundraisers, and volunteer opportunities, both at UCLA and within the wider Los Angeles community. PAC is constantly seeking to unite students, activists, and leaders around our cause, and with 17 diverse committees, PAC has a place for you. We welcome any students passionate about creating an AIDS-free generation and working with an amazing team in the process; otherwise, we’ll see you at Dance Marathon!

People’s Parity Project

People’s Parity Project (PPP) is a movement of law students and attorneys organizing for a democratized legal system which empowers working people and opposes subordination in any form. Together, we are dismantling a profession that upholds corporate power and building in its place a legal system that reflects our values of justice, equity, and solidarity. PPP is committed to unrigging the civil legal system, focusing on the role lawyers and the legal profession have played in rigging that system. The organization’s focus is on righting lawyer-created harms and supporting the communities most impacted by those harms. PPP’s work is motivated by a desire to create a new kind of law student and lawyering: a legal culture that prioritizes true justice over prestige and what is right over what is profitable.

Queer Alliance

Queer Alliance at UCLA was formed to provide a bridge between all progressive LGBTQ+ organizations dealing with issues that touch people who are traditionally disadvantaged on the basis of sexual orientation, romantic attraction, gender expression, and/or gender identity. Queer Alliance recognizes the existence of past conflicts and tension amongst groups of various cultures and seeks to address these issues by serving as a bastion of greater understanding to which all interested parties can look towards as an example of the true spirit of cooperation through facilitation. The alliance looks forwards to maintaining its commitment to respect, understanding, equity, and equality while underscoring the need for the eradication of heteronormativity, queerphobia, and cisheterosexism outside and within the community at UCLA. These goals are achieved by fostering spaces wherein community can thrive, and engaging in social programming and advocacy efforts.

Students For Socialism

Students For Socialism is the student affiliate of the Party for Socialism and Liberation, a national organization involved in a wide range of struggles, from local battles over affordable housing and racist police brutality, to global issues of imperialist war and environmental destruction. SFS continues this tradition and attempts to merge the struggles of oppressed and exploited people with the fight for socialism. We are united in our belief that capitalism—a system where all wealth and power is held by a small group of billionaires and their state—is the source of the main problems confronting humanity today. It must be replaced by socialism, a system where poor and working people control all the wealth and power of society, using it to plan for and meet the needs of the people and planet.

Swipe Out Hunger

At UCLA, Swipe Out Hunger is committed to addressing food insecurity among students and the broader community through advocacy, education, and direct service. Our mission is to ensure that every student has access to nutritious food by organizing the Swipes Drive and administering a meal voucher program, as well as engaging in other initiatives that reduce food insecurity and minimize food waste across the greater LA area. Through the Swipes Drive, held at the end of each quarter, students with meal plans can donate unused meal swipes that would otherwise go unused. These swipes are redistributed to food-insecure students living off-campus. In the past year alone, we’ve collected over 100,000 meal swipes! Our organization also runs various volunteer programs, including gleaning fresh produce from local farmers' markets, organizing large-scale meal preparation events to raise awareness about food insecurity, preparing meals for women's and veterans' shelters, and participating in food justice and activism efforts on and off campus.

The Westwood Food Cooperative

The WWFC is a mission-driven club whose goal is to create a more just and sustainable food system. We envision a world where farmers & growers are compensated fairly for their labor; where soil and land are treated as the invaluable resources that they are; and where all people have access to culturally appropriate, locally grown, highly nutritious food for an affordable price. We’re challenging the unequal distribution of food access in our market, driven by the United States’ subsidization of commodity crops that prioritizes quantity and revenue over public health. Our CSA program provides a radical alternative to this system by supplying locally grown food to our student body that is affordable & accessible. Additionally, our programs aim to reconnect consumers with the land and people who grew the food they eat, as we believe that our most intimate connection to our planet is the food it grows for us. We are also committed to partnering with other campus clubs to provide fresh produce to food-insecure students. Lastly, we write and publish articles that spread awareness about sustainable and ethical farming.

THYRAISE at UCLA

THYRAISE, short for Thyroid Awareness, Innovation, Support, and Education, is a novel organization dedicated to increasing awareness and advocating for thyroid syndromes and cancers across Los Angeles and ultimately nationally. Central to its mission is the enhancement of patient awareness concerning the critical need for transparency with physicians about hormonal supplements. To fulfill this objective, THYRAISE has a strategic plan consisting of several key actions: First, the organization intends to collaborate with endocrinologists throughout the LA area to initiate clinical studies and surveys aimed at assessing patients' trust in their doctors, particularly regarding discussions about hormonal supplements. This initiative is designed to identify gaps in communication and foster a culture of openness and informed consent in patient care. Secondly, THYRAISE is set to develop a range of educational materials, including brochures, intended for distribution within endocrinology offices across Los Angeles. These materials are intended to educate patients on thyroid conditions, treatments, and risks of Over-The-Counter (OTC) thyroid supplements, providing them with the knowledge to engage in meaningful dialogues with their healthcare providers about the use of hormonal supplements. Lastly, THYRAISE plans to engage with policymakers and California state representatives, advocating for the enactment of legislation or directives that would enforce stricter regulations on the approval and accessibility of Over-The-Counter (OTC) thyroid supplements. Club members will also be active in the thyroidology community, attending events such as the USC Thyroid Day. Through these concerted efforts, THYRAISE aims to make a significant impact in the realm of thyroid health, focused on the causes of transparency, patient empowerment, and regulatory reform.

Yolotzonyo

Established in 1996, Yolotzonyo is a youth empowerment project that aims to affirm under-resourced students in the Los Angeles area that they have the potential to pursue their goals whether that be higher education or other non-academic routes. Yolotzonyo is an Indigenous Nahua term that translates to “heart rooted in the community.” Thus, Yolotzonyo builds connections to our hearts, self, our community, and the land. Yolotzonyo’s mission is to cultivate students to be critical of their education and community conditions so they can become agents of change. Yolotzonyo services high school youth and non-traditional continuation students by centering social justice, college readiness, and alternative career paths to academia In addition, Yolotzonyo conducts an annual community organizing internship where we develop UCLA undergraduate students as community organizers by introducing them to the practical tools of social and restorative justice. Through restorative justice we foster healthy discourse, relationships, and critical dialogue.

Young Democratic Socialists of America at UCLA

Young Democratic Socialists of America is the youth and student section of the Democratic Socialists of America, and a national organization of recognized campus chapters and several hundred activists. We are students organizing in our universities, colleges, and high schools to fight for the immediate needs of workers and students while building our capacity to fight for more radical and structural changes. YDSA fights for democratic socialism through active campaigns that challenge capitalist exploitation and oppression. We support organized labor by joining picket lines and joining unions. We organize to defend immigrants through campaigns for sanctuary campuses. We engage in strategic electoral work with candidates who will fight for the working class. We campaign to divest our schools from fossil fuels. We do anti-poverty work through local mutual aid programs in our communities, and much much more. We also provide peer-led political education and organizer training programs to sharpen our skills and analysis. The Democratic Socialists of America is the largest socialist organization in the United States. We believe that working people should run both the economy and society democratically to meet human needs, not to make profits for a few.
