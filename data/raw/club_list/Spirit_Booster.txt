Modern Love @UCLA

A club inspired by the New York Times column "Modern Love", focused on celebrating diverse love stories through a monthly/bi-monthly newsletter that showcases stories, essays, and refl�ections about modern love. The club serves as a platform to amplify diverse voices and experiences–and is open for anyone to submit their pieces to the club for publication. The club consists of illustrators who create illustrations to pair up with accepted submissions, similar to how the NYT Modern Love column is run. Guest Speakers: Invite guest speakers, such as authors, members from allied clubs on Campus, and individuals who have shared their own love stories in the Modern Love column, to provide insights and engage in Q&A sessions. Modern Love @UCLA also aims to organize workshops on storytelling and creative writing to encourage members to share their own love stories, whether they are heartwarming, humorous, or thought-provoking. Every once in a while, we screen episodes from the Modern Love show on Amazon that explore the themes of love and relationships, followed by group discussions and conversation. The Modern Love @ UCLA is a celebration of human connection and diversity. It provides a space for members to connect, learn, and share in the beauty and challenges of love in all its forms.

Student Alumni Association at UCLA, The

The purpose of the Student Alumni Association (SAA) is to facilitate interaction between students and alumni, and to enhance the student experience by providing opportunities that strengthen their lifelong loyalty to UCLA. We do this through a variety of programs, including professional, spirit, and tradition-based events. In addition to our outwardly facing events, we have two committees dedicated to the internal growth, leadership development, and community building of our members.
