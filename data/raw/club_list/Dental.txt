Manual Dexterity for Charity

Manual dexterity is an important component in preparing for dental school and a contributing factor to dental school applications. However, many pre-dental students tend to overlook its importance or they simply have difficulties finding resources that allow them to develop manual dexterity skills in an enjoyable yet meaningful way. Thus, the purpose of this club is to allow more pre-dental students to come together to have fun while gaining manual dexterity skills through workshops involving activities such as crocheting, knitting, painting, etc. Arts and crafts made by members will be sold during fundraisers and all funds raised will go towards charitable causes.
