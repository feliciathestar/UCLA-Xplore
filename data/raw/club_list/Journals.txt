AI Robotics Ethics Society

As technology advances at an exponential rate, it is imperative that we begin thinking about how Artificial Intelligence (AI) will impact society at different levels of daily life, with a focus on the ethical implications and implementation of AI systems. Notably, the development and involvement in AI ethics by students and professionals is nascent. The foresight of how important it is to regulate AI through the lens of ethical discussion and implementation is of paramount significance within the setting of the rapid development of AI and how it has already permeated of our daily lives. As such, the AI Robotics Ethics Society was founded in 2018 at UCLA by Aaron Hui to promote the awareness and importance of ethical implementation/regulation of AI. AIRES achieves its mission of ensuring AI is created both ethically and responsibly through a three-pronged approach: 1. To host a series of intra- and inter-departmental discussions at universities on AI and Robotics ethics. 2. To create a network and promote such awareness through hosting discussions and conferences with chapters of the AI Robotics Ethics Society. 3. To create a small lecture series on the latest breakthroughs and achievements in AI and Robotic ethics.

Aleph: Undergraduate Research Journal for the Humanities and Social Sciences

Aleph (pronounced “ah-lef”) is UCLA’s only official journal publishing undergraduate research in the humanities, social sciences, and behavioral sciences. Run by undergraduates who review submissions, Aleph publishes select submissions on-line, and in an annual “best of” print journal, with the support of our sponsor, the UCLA Undergraduate Research Center. Our goal is to disseminate a diverse group of papers that reflects the quality and breadth of undergraduate research at UCLA. Aleph offers an opportunity for motivated UCLA undergraduates to have their academic work published online and in print. By making UCLA’s undergraduate research available to a larger audience, we hope to broaden the impact and appeal of undergraduate research. As a student-run journal, Aleph provides all UCLA undergraduates the chance to join its staff and gain volunteer experience in publicizing, editing, and publishing.

Philosophy Club at UCLA

The chief goal of the Philosophy Club is to provide a space for students to share and discuss ideas in an open-minded, friendly and respectful environment. This is a place where you can grapple with philosophical questions, and we can mutually work together to try to better our understanding of the world, our behavior within it, and whether or not we are justified in our beliefs. Whether you have only a budding interest in philosophy or if you are well versed in philosophical discourse, the club is a great way to expand your knowledge of the field and make friends along the way. WEEKLY MEETING Meetings are held every Tuesday at 6 pm in Dodd 399 (On Discord https://discord.gg/8YcZ3Uu during pandemics). During meetings, we discuss a specific philosophical issue for about an hour and a half. Topics are chosen and presented by any club members and often explore topics not commonly covered in undergraduate courses, e.g.: philosophy of progress, experience machine, and animal rights. We encourage you to present your own ideas! Sometimes we host philosophy-themed movie nights instead. We often go to Westwood for dinner after our weekly meetings to continue the discussion. MEDITATIONS PHILOSOPHY JOURNAL Meditations is the undergraduate journal of philosophy at UCLA. The purpose of the journal is to foster philosophical thought and provide an opportunity for undergraduates to gain writing and publishing experience. Maybe you have a philosophy paper that you’re really proud of, or you’re looking for a platform to test your arguments and be challenged. Maybe you have some cool ideas but hate writing when a grade depends on it. We encourage undergraduates of any major to participate in Meditations. BOOKCLUBS You can also be a part of our book club. The book club offers a chance to do a close reading of philosophical texts. During our weekly discussions, we will try to understand the ideas presented in the readings by breaking down nuances such as rhetoric and symbolism. OTHER PROGRAMS We encourage members to attend events organized by the Philosophy Department. We also cooperate with the department to plan events for you. For example coffee time with professors, study lounge, and information panel, and more. Facebook: Undergraduate Philosophy Club at UCLA
