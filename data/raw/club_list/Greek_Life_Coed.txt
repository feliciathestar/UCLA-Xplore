Center for Language, Interaction and Culture Graduate Student Association (CLIC GSA)

CLIC GSA is a student organization that promotes interdisciplinary work at the intersections of language, culture, and conversational activities. Members include primarily graduate (and also undergraduate) students from Anthropology, Applied Linguistics, Asian Languages & Cultures, Education, and Sociology. CLIC GSA hosts an annual conference in conjunction with the UC Santa Barbara Language, Interaction, and Social Organization (LISO) graduate student association. The conference is hosted at UCLA every other year. CLIC GSA also occasionally hosts workshops and speaker series, during which students are able to discuss their research and receive feedback from colleagues and faculty members, as well as learn strategies for professional development. We are dedicated in providing an inclusive environment for engaging fruitful academic discussions and celebrating the vibrant and diverse community of young scholars in the fields of language, interaction, and/or culture. Any graduate and undergraduate students at UCLA are eligible to join the group or volunteer in our many activities simply by signing up with the CLIC GSA mailing list.

Graduate Student Association of Archaeology

The Graduate Student Association of Archaeology (GSAA) encourages the investigation of material culture and human behavior through archaeological research, discussion, and collaboration. It is the principal organizing body for all graduate students in the Cotsen Institute of Archaeology, although it welcomes applications from any UCLA graduate student with an interest in archaeology. The GSAA functions as a forum for its members to elect representatives, make collective decisions, organize events, and share concerns and news that pertain to the Cotsen IoA, the broader UCLA community, and the discipline of archaeology as a whole. Such matters include, but are not limited to, teaching assistant responsibilities and experiences, graduate curriculum, graduate student funding, career possibilities, publishing opportunities, and research. The GSAA endeavors to serve the academic and social wellbeing of its members.

Iranian Graduate and Professional Association (IGPA)

The Iranian Graduate and Professional Association (IGPA) is dedicated to serving Iranian graduate and professional scholars across the UCLA campus. We estimate that there are approximately 500 Iranian graduate and professional scholars at UCLA, spanning various fields including medical, STEM, and non-STEM disciplines. Our primary focus is to foster a sense of community among these Iranian scholars, many of whom are thousands of miles away from their families and friends. We achieve this by organizing events that celebrate Iranian culture and scheduling both professional and informal gatherings where scholars can connect with their peers, seek guidance, and build a professional network. These gatherings are particularly beneficial during the Fall quarter, as newcomers can obtain helpful academic and non-academic information. For a more detailed overview of our group's foundation and objectives, please refer to our constitution. Additionally, our Instagram profile (@igpaatucla) offers insights into our past events and provides updates on upcoming ones.
