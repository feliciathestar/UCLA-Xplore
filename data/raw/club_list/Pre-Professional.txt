Global Development Lab at UCLA

At UCLA, students are presented with various academic avenues to explore the theoretical basis behind poverty, development, and globalization. However, the path to knowledge ends at theory, wherein there exists no place for students to translate their theoretical knowledge base into practical action. Global Development Lab at UCLA endeavors to provide a results-driven space for students to research, incubate, and implement innovative ideas that generate social impact. Through professionally-led workshops, internship placements, research projects, and development model experimentation, GDL equips students with the tangible skills and resources necessary to successfully foster responsible global development initiatives.?

Sigma Eta Pi

Founded in 2010 at the University of California Los Angeles, Sigma Eta Pi is the first entrepreneurship fraternity on the West Coast and aims to support UCLA students’ entrepreneurial pursuits. We’re a diverse group of students of all majors with many interests but one in common- being drawn to and cultivating an entrepreneurial spirit. Members of Sigma Eta Pi have started over 21 different ventures. These include two backed by Y-Combinator (one of which was acquired by Square for $90 million), five fully funded projects (two by Venture Capital, three by crowd-sourced funding), and the largest hackathon the nation has ever seen. Apart from our student entrepreneurs, a majority of our members end up going to rising startups. On a more regular basis, we provide internal mentorship, alumni connections, private office tours, workshops, external info sessions, campus events, and most importantly, a community for entrepreneurially-minded students on UCLA’s campus.
