Bruin MMA Theory

Bruin MMA Theory takes an analytical and theoretical approach to learning martial arts. Bruin MMA Theory has no physical contact or applications of any martial arts, but will look over film and analyze aspects of all martial arts to grow passion and understanding of the sport. Our aims include: uniting students who have a deep passion for mixed martial arts, increasing our collective understanding and appreciation of various martial arts (such as Judo, Jujitsu, Sambo, and Muay Thai) and their cultural backgrounds, advocating for the countless benefits of martial arts as a subject of analysis for self-defense, agility, coordination, and awareness, providing a platform for members to discuss and learn about striking and grappling techniques without any physical practice, providing members the opportunity to study fight choreography for martial arts and action films, and giving members the opportunity to analyze martial arts techniques after watching fights and write reports.
