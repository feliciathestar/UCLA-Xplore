Latine Film & Theatre Association (LFTA)

This organization strives to center Latine voices in creative spaces as well as create an annual theatre and film showcase that unites and empowers the Chicane/x & Latine/x community on campus. Our organization’s objective is to provide a space for students to discuss and address issues that the Latine community faces through the use of art and performance. We seek to be an inclusive organization both in the content we create and in our collaborations with various other organizations on campus. The Latine population has been historically underrepresented and misrepresented in the entertainment industry for far too long, and LFTA is working to change that with our productions. The content of our Night of Cultura Showcase shall vary each year in the attempt to address issues that are important and relevant to the Chicane/x & Latine/x community. Issues of politics, gender, sexuality, nationality, history, controversies, etc. and —most importantly— culture are to be the center of dramatic focus. In this way, The Night of Cultura Showcase offers two nights of entertainment, fun, laughter, reflection, but most importantly, empowerment and a sense of pride in the cultural richness of Latin America. The Latine Film and Theatre Association strives to promote a space where Latine creatives can express themselves truly and freely, learn skills within film and theater production, learn to navigate professional settings in film and theater, have fun while learning, feel supported in their creative endeavors, and form bonds and connections with other Latine creatives.

Modern Love @UCLA

The club serves as a platform to amplify diverse voices and experiences–and is open for anyone to submit their pieces to the club for publication. The club consists of illustrators who create illustrations to pair up with accepted submissions, similar to how the NYT Modern Love column is run. Guest Speakers: Invite guest speakers, such as authors, members from allied clubs on Campus, and individuals who have shared their own love stories in the Modern Love column, to provide insights and engage in Q&A sessions. Modern Love @UCLA also aims to organize workshops on storytelling and creative writing to encourage members to share their own love stories, whether they are heartwarming, humorous, or thought-provoking. Every once in a while, we screen episodes from the Modern Love show on Amazon that explore the themes of love and relationships, followed by group discussions and conversation. The Modern Love @ UCLA is a celebration of human connection and diversity. It provides a space for members to connect, learn, and share in the beauty and challenges of love in all its forms.

OutWrite Newsmagazine

OutWrite Newsmagazine is the official queer newsmagazine of the University of California, Los Angeles. OutWrite strives to build a growing educational platform through a multi-media approach that uplifts and empowers the often silenced voices of the incredibly diverse queer community. We aim to challenge dominant cisheteronormative narratives through an unapologetically anti-queerphobic, anti-racist, and progressive lens. OutWrite was established in 1979 under its original title TenPercent, becoming the first queer college publication in the country. The name TenPercent was chosen from the Alfred Kinsey’s study Sexual Behavior in the Human Male which stated that 10% of men identified as homosexual. In 2005, the newsmagazine’s staff petitioned to change the name to OutWrite to decenter the white, cis, gay male identity and use a name which better represents the queer community’s vast spectrum of identities. Throughout the years, the newsmagazine referred to itself as a "gay and lesbian" newsmagazine, slowly adding more identities to its moniker just as the mainstream community did in the late 20th century. Our label has since been changed to "queer" newsmagazine to recognize both the importance of inclusivity in our community and the inherent radical nature of our mission; queer is a verb and political statement as much as it is an umbrella descriptor encompassing the ever-growing LGBTQ+ acronym. OutWrite is proud to transform and adapt itself to better represent and serve queer people, changing its own identity as our community grows and changes.

Planet Pose aims to cultivate, inspire, motivate, and showcase UCLA's unique personal style of their student's everyday lives. POSE is dedicated to providing a world at UCLA for bold fashion enthusiasts to express themselves, discuss bizarre finds, and create together. You can share creations, have photoshoots, even perhaps a mini runway if you desire…anything can happen on our little planet. We heavily emphasize on inclusivity: if you are part of a marginalized group (POC, LGBTQ+, etc), POSE will be a space dedicated to making you feel included, listened, and seen. POSE emphasizes body neutrality over body positivity because not everyone can be in love with who they are but at least be comfortable in their own skin… or perhaps their own style.

The Black Film & Theater Initiative at UCLA

The Black Film and Theater Initiative (BFTI) is a student-led organization that intends to uplift and showcase Black media art from artists across the African Diaspora. This art includes, but is not limited to, films, plays, television pilots, screenplays, and other forms of written content. Black art is a commodity that is celebrated globally. However Black artists are underrepresented and neglected by many in the western world. As the entertainment industry evolves over time, conversations of representation, inclusivity, and equity highlight the importance of Black artistry. We at the Black and Film Theater Initiative want to push for diverse storytelling for all inspired Black artists. We are looking to tell authentic stories of Black life from various perspectives and different artists. The organization is led by students from the School of Theater, Film & Television, however membership extends to students from various majors with a passion for storytelling. All student work culminates in the Rebellion Remembrance Festival in February, which is a three-day student showcase of films, television pilots, plays, and monologues. The first day will be a film festival; the second day will be a showing of plays and monologues; the third day will be an award show and Q&A with the creators. The showcase is a tribute to the L.A. Rebellion, where BIPOC filmmakers from UCLA produced work that told authentic Black stories. As an organization, the Black Film and Theater Initiative will provide students with resources, collaborators, and confidence in themselves to create meaningful art, regardless of expertise or experience.
