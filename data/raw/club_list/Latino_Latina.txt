Destino de UCLA

Latinos are the future of the United States! We’re a fast-growing and young community. Right now 1 out of every 5 kids born in this country is Latino. And more Latino/a students are enrolling in college than at any other time in history! For us, it’s about more than numbers. We believe that God has a special destiny for Latinos. He is going to use Latinos to change this nation and change the world. And so we exist to help raise up a generation of leaders from the Latino and Hispanic communities to change the world!
