Addiction Awareness Association (AAA)

Introduction: The Addiction Awareness Association (AAA) is a dynamic and dedicated college club committed to addressing one of the most pressing public health issues of our time – addiction. Founded on the principles of compassion, education, and community involvement, AAA has been making a profound impact on and off campus by raising awareness, preventing addiction, and connecting vulnerable communities with crucial rehabilitation resources. In this comprehensive description, we will delve into the mission, activities, and impact of AAA, highlighting its invaluable role in fostering a society that is better informed, more compassionate, and equipped to battle addiction. Mission and Vision: The core mission of the Addiction Awareness Association is to bridge the gap between local needs and rehabilitation resources to combat addiction effectively. AAA envisions a society where addiction is met with understanding, support, and accessible resources, rather than stigma and isolation. This vision is founded on the belief that addiction is a treatable illness, and those affected by it deserve a chance at recovery, regardless of their background. Key Objectives: 1. Awareness: AAA seeks to dispel myths and misconceptions surrounding addiction. Through workshops, seminars, and awareness campaigns, the club strives to educate the college community and the wider public about the root causes, consequences, and signs of addiction. 2. Prevention: AAA takes a proactive approach by working to prevent addiction before it takes hold. Club members engage in outreach programs to educate local schools, colleges, and communities about the dangers of substance abuse, providing information on risk factors and healthy coping strategies. 3. Rehabilitation: The heart of AAA's mission is to connect vulnerable communities with rehabilitation resources. Club members actively research and collaborate with local rehab centers, support groups, and counselors to ensure that those in need can access treatment and support. Approach: AAA operates on a needs-based approach, recognizing that addiction impacts different communities in various ways. The club seeks to understand the specific challenges faced by local communities and tailors its initiatives accordingly. This empathetic approach allows AAA to make a meaningful impact and build trust within the communities it serves. Activities and Initiatives: 1. Community Surveys: AAA conducts regular surveys and interviews within the local community to gauge the extent of addiction-related issues. These surveys are vital in identifying gaps in knowledge and resources. 2. Resource Coordination: Once needs are identified, AAA collaborates with local rehab centers, support groups, and healthcare providers to connect individuals struggling with addiction to appropriate resources. This includes organizing transportation, financial assistance, and counseling services. 3. Awareness Campaigns: AAA organizes a variety of awareness campaigns, from informational flyers and online webinars to panel discussions and guest speakers. These events aim to educate both the college campus and the wider community about addiction and its impact. 4. School Outreach: Members of AAA visit local schools to engage with students on the dangers of substance abuse, providing them with age-appropriate information and resources to make informed decisions. 5. Peer Support: The club runs support groups for individuals in recovery, providing a safe and non-judgmental space for sharing experiences and offering peer support. Impact: The Addiction Awareness Association's impact extends beyond the college campus. By focusing on local needs and collaborating with existing resources, AAA has played a pivotal role in improving the lives of individuals and communities affected by addiction. Some of the key impacts include: 1. Increased Awareness: AAA has reached thousands of individuals through its awareness campaigns, contributing to a better-informed society that is more empathetic towards those struggling with addiction. 2. Prevention: By educating local schools and colleges, AAA has helped prevent substance abuse among young adults, empowering them to make healthier choices. 3. Rehabilitation Support: Through its resource coordination efforts, AAA has facilitated hundreds of individuals' access to treatment, counseling, and support services. 4. Community Engagement: The club has fostered a sense of community among those affected by addiction, reducing isolation and stigma and promoting a supportive environment for recovery. Conclusion: The Addiction Awareness Association embodies the spirit of volunteerism, compassion, and community engagement. By addressing addiction at its core and working tirelessly to bridge the gap between local needs and rehabilitation resources, AAA has become a beacon of hope for individuals and communities grappling with the scourge of addiction.

American Cancer Society On Campus

American Cancer Society On Campus (ACS) is a collegiate branch of the American Cancer Society that brings the fight against cancer directly to college students by planning Relay for Life at UCLA, encouraging education, inspiring advocacy, and celebrating survivorship. Mainly, we aim to build a community for those affected by cancer and work so that one day, no one has to hear the dreaded words "you have cancer." Relay for Life is a 24-hour fundraising festival held at Drake Stadium to celebrate survivors, remember those we've lost, and fight back against a disease that affects and connects us all in some way! The event includes inspiring ceremonies, our Relay Runway Pageant, talented performers, a silent rave, and so much more. In the past five years, we raised over $1,000,000 for the American Cancer Society to fund cancer research and patient services to support those battling, making us the largest college Relay West of the Mississippi! Throughout the year, in addition to planning Relay, we also plan education rallies on Bruin Walk for various types of cancers, organize hospital visits to bring cards to patients on the Oncology floor, and host fundraising events such as comedy shows and concerts! Since our start 20 years ago, American Cancer Society On Campus has been recognized with the Leaders of Hope award three years in a row, Survivor & Caregiver Engagement Chapter of the Year three years in a row, Advocacy Chapter of the Year, and Top Fundraiser of the year.

Anesthesiology Student Interest Group (ASIG)

The Anesthesiology Interest Group at David Geffen School of Medicine aims to increase awareness and interest in Anesthesiology as it is a specialty that students have very little exposure to in the preclinical as well as in many students’ clinical years. It provides opportunities for students to learn about the specialty, become involved in research/mentorship/shadowing, and acquire hands-on practical skills with common procedures and techniques. We provide opportunities to attend anesthesia related workshops such as an airways lab to allow students to gain experience in intubating a patient and doing a cricothyroidotomy. We complete this mission through a variety of activities: -Airway management workshop co-hosted with other DGSOM student interest groups. Students are given a short introductory presentation on airway anatomy, followed by a hands-on workshop where students learn and practice intubation, as well as work with Glidescopes, fiber optic scopes, LMAs, and mask ventilation. -Pre-shadowing orientation in the Anesthesiology department at UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center. -Multiple interactive, case-based talks given by residents and professors of the Anesthesiology department at UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center.

Barrow Neurological Institute at UCLA

Barrow Neurological Institute at UCLA is a non-profit student organization that fosters collaboration between the Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI) and UCLA. The organization’s mission is to engage UCLA students in fundraising initiatives to support BNI’s Neurocritical Care Department. Raising funds for the Neurocritical Care Center allows members to be part of something far greater than individual opportunities—a chance to directly support patients and families in critical need, offering hope and relief during their most vulnerable moments. In addition to fundraising, the organization provides students with an opportunity to compete for two UCLA-reserved spots of thirty in BNI’s prestigious summer research internship program, which may include placement in the Neurocritical Care Unit. This paid internship offers housing, access to physician mentorship, shadowing opportunities, and other valuable educational experiences. Inspired by this cause, members channel their passion into creating a lasting impact, knowing that their efforts today can change lives for generations to come.

Bioethics Student Interest Group

The DGSOM Bio-Ethics group is a student-led interest group committed to providing students with a unique forum to learn about and discuss ethical issues as they pertain to human health, biomedical research, and clinical healthcare practices. Our goals are to stimulate discussion of potential ethical issues that students may encounter in their careers, and to equip students with several basic strategies to think through ethical dilemmas within a structured, rational framework. As a secondary objective, we aim to advocate for greater incorporation of medical ethics into the DGSOM curriculum. These objectives will be accomplished through student-led meetings, inviting guest speakers to discuss actual cases, and working with the DGSOM administration on curriculum reform projects. A student-led medical ethics panel will provide additional opportunities for students to discuss actual cases brought forth by fellow students, residents, or faculty, and to reinforce the knowledge gained from their interest in bioethics.

Cardiology Interest Group at DGSOM

STATEMENT OF PURPOSE - The goal of the Cardiology Interest Group is to expose future physicians to different fields within cardiology at an early stage in training. To do so, we will organize regular sessions during which leaders in their field have an opportunity to speak to first- and second-year medical students about their work and the current trends in the field of cardiology. Students will benefit by getting early exposure to cardiology, plus the privilege to hear some wonderful doctors whom they would not otherwise come in contact with so early in their training. We will also provide shadowing opportunities, enabling students to get hands-on experience with cardiology patients. Lastly, the Cardiology Interest Group will provide opportunities for medical students to get to know cardiology fellows and attending physicians through social events and mixers, thus creating a collegial atmosphere to foster interest in cardiology. We hope this group will spark interest in pursuing a career path in one of the cardiology specialties to balance the growing need for cardiologists both in the clinical and research realms. PROVISION TO MAKE FINANCIAL RECORDS AVAILABLE - We will make financial records available to university administrators upon request. UC NONDISCRIMINATION STATEMENT – Cardiology Interest Group does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, gender identity, pregnancy, disability, age, medical condition (cancer-related), ancestry, marital status, citizenship, sexual orientation, or status as a Vietnam-era veteran or special disabled veteran. This also prohibits sexual harassment. ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE (officers) – A minimum of three officers (co-coordinators) will be elected leaders in the organization in each academic year, up to a maximum of eight officers based on student interest. Officers will be elected at the beginning of each academic year. The membership of the organization shall consist of any UCLA undergraduate or graduate student. All officers of the student organizations must be current UCLA undergraduates or graduate students. Officers found not to be a current UCLA student will be removed immediately. ELIGIBILITY FOR VOTING PRIVILEGES and VOTING PROCEDURES – officers will vote annually on changes to the constitution. PROCEDURES FOR AMENDING THE CONSTITUTION – changes to the constitution will be made upon a simple majority vote by the officers.

Clinical and Translational Science Institute-Research Associate Program

The CTSI (Clinical Translational Science Institution) Research Associates Program (RAP) is a pilot program that provides undergraduates exposure to hospital based medicine as well as clinical research. As a research associate, RAP members play a key role in the implementation and maintenance of research protocols in their respective study locations (e.g. the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU), under Pulmonary and Critical Care Physicians at RRH). We are given the opportunity to make rounds with the medical team, observe common procedures, and experience didactic teaching sessions during the course of the research day. As a result, the aim is to become comfortable with the workings of a hospital and gain skills in professionalism, patient communication, and research methodology. This program was established by Dr. Elizabeth Turner (critical care, pulmonary disease) in association with the Clinical and Translational Science Institution (CTSI). Currently CTSI-RAP and the clinical research training is led by Dr. Laurie Shaker-Irwin (CTSI advisor). Follow us on FB: https://www.facebook.com/CTSIRAP

Cope Health Scholars Chapter

The COPE Health Scholars chapter is a volunteer program providing opportunities for students to gain hands-on experience working on the hospital floor in various units, such as med-surg, peri op, the emergency room, oncology, and so forth. Additionally, the program offers opportunities for scholars to travel outside of the US to see health initiatives in foreign countries. Our club seeks to promote the organization to pre-health students here at UCLA and prepare future scholars for what they may expect in the program and provide resources that will help them to succeed. These resources include informational sessions regarding how to prepare for their program interview and practical floor exam, workshops with existing COPE scholars on how to join leadership positions, and guest speaker sessions for club members to ask healthcare professionals questions regarding their experience in the field of medicine. We aim to help create a supportive and inclusive environment within our organization, and want to ensure that our volunteers learn skills that they can carry with them in the hospital setting.

Our objectives include: In order to fulfill our goals and objectives, we will utilize faculty support to provide lunchtime talks, offer mentorship opportunities, have regular meetings among medical students in their didactic and clinical training, and establish open communication among students conducting research in dermatology at UCLA. The structure of DIG includes a committee focused on didactics (lunchtime discussions), and a cabinet consisting of a president, vice president, secretary, and treasurer. DIG will also include both upperclassmen and underclassmen so that both clinical and didactic aspects of DIG can be better addressed and included in DIG meetings. The role of our faculty advisor is to assist DIG members in exploration of long range occupational and professional plans in dermatology, refer students to sources for specialized assistance in dermatology, and to contribute awareness of opportunities in laboratories, clinics, and field experiences. Membership includes graduate students, medical students, and faculty.

DREAM - Driving Resilience through Empowerment, Advocacy, Mentorship

Driving Resilience through Empowerment, Advocacy, and Mentorship (DREAM) is a student organization at the David Geffen School of Medicine that brings together UCLA medical students, undergraduates, and medical faculty to empower historically minoritized youth. As a key partner of Gardena High School's new Medical Emergency Services Academy (MESA), DREAM has worked closely with Gardena High School to provide medical and clinical skills training on ultrasound, clinical problem solving, and life-saving measures such as Stop the Bleed and overdose reversal. These trainings are critical, not only because they empower underserved youth to pursue careers in health medicine and slowly add to the mosaic of representation, but also because they propagate life-saving information throughout communities neglected by systems of healthcare and health education.

This organization aims to explore the mutual effects of environmental and human health on one another and their impact on the world at large. The club will include initiatives to spread awareness regarding the intersection of climate change and medicine and explore questions such as natural disasters have downstream impacts and affect patient care in unprecedented ways, how the medical industry contributes to climate change and pollution, how environmental concerns such as pollution affects noncommunicable diseases. As environmental issues and climate change intensify, their effects on human health will continue to grow. While these issues are intimately linked, they are under addressed so this club will seek to raise awareness of issues of how public health and environmental issues are linked and brainstorm solutions.

Happy Feet Clinic

How to help L.A.’s homeless? One foot at a time. Without homes or any mode of transportation, hundreds of homeless people walk an average of 13 miles a day. Some walk for days, weeks, or months without having access to basic necessities such as clean water or properly fitted shoes. Many even refuse to air out their feet, conducive of many foot problems, afraid that their shoes might get stolen. As we, Happy Feet Clinic, provide those basic necessities and more, we are blessed with a powerfully humbling experience. At shelters around Los Angeles, including the Union Rescue Mission in downtown L.A., the Ocean Park Community Center in Santa Monica, the New Image Emergency Shelter in South LA, and PATH in Westwood, we treat hundreds of homeless people to a soothing foot wash in a tub of warm, soapy water. Next, we work side by side with podiatrists as they administer foot exams for the homeless community. Throughout the process, we interact with a variety of people in need of help and most importantly become aware of the large prominence of under-served communities and their critical need for assistance. For many students, it is hard to grasp how prominent this population is in a thriving country as America. At first, students squirm at the thought of washing feet (especially those that may need much more care than our own). As soon as the event comes to an end however, many are instilled with the feeling to return again and again. The power to help someone who has lost family, work, and shelter and put a smile on their face is an amazing feeling. This is what makes our organization unique. Any student with an interest in reaching out to under-served communities is invited to join.

Health Equity in Nursing (HEN)

This organization focuses on promoting health equity within nursing. We aim to explore topics such as, but not limited to: anti-racism, culturally-humble care, social and structural determinants of health, trauma-informed care, and health disparities among marginalized populations. Our goal is to facilitate discussions and events centering on the impact of these intersecting issues on community health, thereby fostering intrapersonal, interpersonal, and collective growth among UCLA nursing students and within the UCLA community overall. We believe that, as healthcare providers serving diverse populations, it is of utmost importance that we better understand how societal injustices are rooted deeply in a historical context and are continuously reproduced to the detriment of achieving health equity for marginalized groups. It is our duty as student nurses to provide the best possible care to those we serve. In order to achieve this aim, we must learn to address our own internal biases and understand relevant historical and cultural context in order to advocate for our patients. We also want to think critically about how nurses, and other healthcare professionals, have been complicit in these systems of injustice throughout history, and how we can instead use our positions to dismantle these inequities. Ultimately, we envision a future healthcare system that is more just and more equitable, and we aim to play a role in its creation.

Health-Link Society at UCLA

Health-Link Society (HLS) was launched in 2020 amidst the constraints of the COVID-19 pandemic by Zakaria Alyan and Shakibur Rahman, two visionary undergraduate students at Temple University. Their mission was to build a diverse and inclusive community of students with a passion for philanthropy and a keen interest in healthcare careers. Recognizing the lack of volunteering opportunities and the diminishing sense of community among students due to the pandemic, they swiftly acted to bridge this gap, fostering meaningful engagements between aspiring healthcare professionals and their local communities for mutual growth. Our HLS chapter at UCLA will have an emphasis on healthcare and community service, and is designed to serve underprivileged communities while also prioritizing the professional growth of their members.

Holistic Care

Our organization aims to provide non-medical forms of therapy and relief for patients in hospital and clinic settings, ranging from pediatric to geriatric. These patients are in postoperative or clinic-based recovery for a variety of chronic and debilitating conditions, suffering from isolation and accompanying fears, anxieties and pains. Holistic Care lessens these symptoms through certified patient visits where volunteers employ tactile, auditory and visual therapies to enhance and augment postoperative care. With the help of our research committee, we are constantly learning and implementing psychologically tested techniques, therapies and methods of treatment during these visits. These non-medical forms of relief, both physical and mental, have been proven to transform the lives of patients in need of personalized and thoughtful care. Our volunteers understand the individual needs of each patient and their condition, showing that we care about the wellbeing of every person we serve and we are dedicated to restoring their hope, happiness and health through our innovative applications.

Lifestyle Medicine Interest Group

Lifestyle Medicine is one of the fastest growing career fields of medicine globally. Holding the promise for health reform as it addresses the root-cause of chronic illness, Lifestyle Medicine is the evidence-based practice of helping individuals and families adopt and sustain healthy behaviors that affect health and quality of life. Examples of target patient behaviors include, but are not limited to, eliminating tobacco use, improving diet, increasing physical activity, and moderating alcohol consumption. Medical students across the country have expressed concerns about the lack of lifestyle medicine knowledge surrounding topics such as physical activity, nutrition, and behavior-change strategies. The aspiration of Lifestyle Medicine Interest Group (LMIG) at DGSOM is to equip students with the knowledge and skills necessary to counsel patients about exercise, diet, behavior change, and preventative medicine, taking into account positive psychology and the social determinants of health. The goals of LMIG are to: - Educate students about how to address lifestyle-based management of chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, celiac disease, and obesity. - Train students regarding how to provide accurate and helpful Lifestyle Medicine counseling to patients and make targeted recommendations for patients that would fit their budget, life-style and other socio-economic determinants. - Enrich students’ knowledge about exercise, diet and nutrition, behavior change, positive psychology and wellness coaching, and the power of preventative medicine. - Help students gain confidence when speaking to patients about lifestyle-based health behaviors and offer personalized advice that is accurate and evidence-based. The focus of lunch and learn lectures, presentations, workshops, and participation in community health fairs is not only to educate students about lifestyle medicine and chronic illnesses such as diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity, but to help them integrate the experience that they will acquire in clinical settings and beyond. Members of LMIG will become registered members of the American College of Lifestyle Medicine (ACLM) which will provide evidence-based Lifestyle Medicine training as the first treatment option in clinical practice through live and online CME-accredited events and educational offerings, certification, clinical practice tools, patient education resources, economic research, networking opportunities, national conferences and advocacy efforts.

Medical Aid Initiative (MAI)

The Medical Aid Initiative is a student-founded organization that provides resources to organizations that share the same vision of providing free medical care and health education to both domestic and international communities. Through our partnership with UCLA Health, MAI collects excess medical supplies for use in global health missions. Since U.S. hospitals produce over two million tons of medical waste each year, MAI helps to reallocate usable medical supplies to where they are needed. MAI's mission is to increase sustainability in healthcare, distribute medical supplies to global communities, and increase awareness around the issue of medical waste. Over the last five years, MAI has been able to divert nearly 8,000 pounds of waste from landfills and donated over $450,000 worth of supplies to medical aid organizations around the world.

Muscular Dystrophy Society at DGSOM

Muscular dystrophies (MD) are a genetically and clinically diverse group of rare muscle disorders that lead to the progressive weakening and breakdown of skeletal muscles. With nine types of MD, all characterized by eventual loss of strength and mobility, individuals affected by these conditions face increasing disability and potential deformities. Although there is no cure, ongoing research and treatments provide hope for managing symptoms and improving quality of life. The aim is to empower students to go beyond the classroom and engage in political advocacy and leadership. In partnership with the Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA), we focus not only on muscular dystrophies but also on a wide range of neuromuscular disorders. By working together, we aim to shape healthcare policy and advocate for better patient care and research funding for these rare and often underrepresented diseases. Our mission centers on raising awareness of neuromuscular disorders within the medical and broader communities, while providing students with hands-on opportunities to explore careers in medicine. Through collaboration with national medical organizations and attendance at conferences, students can build professional networks and participate in meaningful discussions around the future of healthcare. These experiences will equip future healthcare leaders with the skills necessary to drive change in both patient care and medical research. Working closely with the MDA to engage in political advocacy at the local, state, and national levels. We advocate for policies that promote funding for neuromuscular disease research, support patient access to cutting-edge treatments, and raise the profile of these rare diseases within the healthcare system. By involving medical students in these efforts, we aim to foster a new generation of physicians who are not only skilled clinicians but also leaders in healthcare policy and patient advocacy. In addition to advocacy, our organization supports opportunities to learn more about MDS and other neuromuscular issues from talented faculty at UCLA involved in research. By partnering with UCLA Health physicians students will gain valuable insights into the challenges and advancements in the treatment of neuromuscular diseases. These efforts will allow students to see firsthand the importance of research in shaping the future of healthcare and improving patient outcomes. By creating a network of student advocates for neuromuscular health, we hope to build a movement dedicated to improving the lives of individuals with neuromuscular diseases. Through leadership, advocacy, and education, the Muscular Dystrophy Society and Neuromuscular Illness Club will work to make a lasting impact on the future of medicine.

Muscular dystrophies are a genetically and clinically heterogeneous group of rare muscle disorders that progressively weaken and breakdown of skeletal muscles over time. There are 9 types of muscular dystrophy, with each type involving an eventual loss of strength, increased disability, and possible deformity. There's currently no cure for muscular dystrophy (MD), but a variety of treatments can help to manage the condition. As different types of MD can cause quite specific problems, the treatment one receives will be tailored to their specific needs. As a member of Muscular Dystrophy Society on Campus (MDS), we aim to raise funds, do volunteer work, and donate to research facilities specialized in MD. We further aim to spread awareness of MD through partnering with the Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA), and bringing to light related neuromuscular diseases in the greater UCLA community. We hope to be able to spread our mission to campuses across the nation and educate students worldwide about MD.

Neurodiversity Health Chats at UCLA

Neurodiversity Health Chats (NDHC) is originally a student led project (now club) led by Dr. Emily Hotez, Ph.D. and the UC-LEND clinic-- and funded by the Association of University Centers on Disabilities (AUCD)-- that seeks to improve the health and well-being of neurodivergent individuals through outreach and education. Since 2021, NDHC has improved access to resources and credible information for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD). NDHC is directly responsive to the well-established findings that neurodivergent populations have experienced disproportionate negative mental and physical health outcomes from the COVID-19 pandemic. NDHC applies a multi-pronged strategy to support neurodivergent populations. First, NDHC leverages social media to translate and disseminate valuable information on vaccination guidelines, needle anxieties, and barriers to vaccination. NDHC is highly adept at creating and disseminating plain language and accessible social media infographics through a range of channels, as well as conducting and sharing in-depth interviews with public health experts and individuals with lived experience. In addition to these outreach efforts, NDHC leads a portfolio of research. Last year, NDHC conducted a qualitative research study that analyzed key themes from interviews with medical and non-medical health professionals, communicators, and individuals with I/DD and their caregivers. Qualitative findings revealed that misinformation, vaccine risk perception, sensory sensitivities, and structural hardship were the most significant barriers to COVID-19 vaccination. In order to be responsive to the findings from our research study, NDHC embarked on the development and dissemination of a virtual CME/CE to promote vaccine confidence, access, and uptake in neurodivergent populations.

The goal of the program is to create a more inclusive environment by utilizing approachable undergraduate mentors and developing a more personal mentor-mentee relationship. There will be a certain number of mentees assigned to a single mentor that will be available to advise them during scheduled office hours that also serve as a study period. Approaching mentoring with low mentor to mentee ratios is what develops the close relationships, and employing undergraduates, who are more relatable than graduate students or professors, creates a more affable environment. Furthermore, we hope to form relationships with other health organizations to create a network for internship and research opportunities. Lastly, we hope to have guest speakers in the medical industry run workshops and speak about their professions.

Sports Medicine Interest Group at DGSOM

The multidimensional aspect of sports medicine is often overlooked. Although the field universally deals with physical injuries related to sports and exercise, many disciplines contribute to this facet of patient care, including orthopaedic surgery, physical medicine and rehabilitation, and primary care. Specifically, the Sports Medicine Interest Group at the DGSOM aims to integrate the multidisciplinary approaches of training, research, and clinical practice involved with exercise science and sports medicine. The goal is to provide a more holistic perspective of the field by incorporating all relevant disciplines and medical expertise through physician panels, relevant training, research opportunities, and lunch discussions.

Student Stroke Force

Recognizing the community need for stroke public education and awareness, the UCLA Stroke Force was formed in 1992 under the leadership and guidance of the late Dr. Sidney Starkman, Head of UCLA Emergency Neurology and Emergency Medicine Director of the UCLA Stroke Center. In the Stroke Force program, undergraduates are involved in double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter research projects investigating the efficacy of various drugs and procedures applied to the patients that arrive in the UCLA Emergency Room with onset of acute ischemic stroke. Students serve as research associates and work alongside neurologists during code strokes. Responsibilities include collecting information relating to the patient’s medical history and neurological deficits in order to identify potential candidates for enrollment in clinical trials that aim to find novel treatments for stroke. Students also serve as speakers who reach out to various communities. To date, more than 200 students have participated in the program, delivering over 300 lectures to over 7000 individuals. Formal testing has demonstrated that these presentations are highly effective, resulting in a significant increase in post-education stroke awareness. Through integrating experiences from clinical exposure in the Ronald Reagan Emergency Department, neurological rounds, health fairs, and presentations, this sect of the Stroke Program strives to provide a force to minimize response time and to facilitate treatment.

Student Stroke Team

In 1992, recognizing the need for earlier detection and treatment of strokes, famed UCLA emergency room physician and neurologist Dr. Sidney Starkman gathered a fortunate group of UCLA undergraduate students and entrusted them with the responsibility to serve as the "eyes and ears" of the UCLA Stroke Network. Since its humble beginnings, the UCLA Stroke Program has split into two separate sister organizations: Student Stroke Team and Stroke Force. Both programs have expanded into well-ordered and effective student-operated organizations, each consisting of roughly 25 students rigorously chosen from UCLA's student body. Students in Student Stroke Team have the opportunity to experience neurorounds, which involve shadowing the Ronald Reagan Stroke Team on their morning rounds. On these neurorounds, students gain exposure to the field of stroke neurology, emergency medicine, and patient interaction. Members also participate in general meetings where they learn and present case studies and lessons about neurovasculature, imaging, the basics of clinical research, and current stroke clinical trials at UCLA. As research associates, students learn the basis for the investigation of new drugs and interventions in stroke, the pre-clinical research, the phases of trials, and the proper interpretation of the results obtained. In their tasks, students utilize their knowledge of the study hypothesis and methodology, patient selection criteria, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and rationale for the use of the drug procedure.

Teddy Bear Hospital DGSOM

Mission Statement Teddy Bear Hospital DGSOM is a branch of the Teddy Bear Hospital USA (TBH) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization run by medical students and undergraduate students. Collectively, members aim to support the local community in promoting medical communication to help reduce clinical anxiety in children. Our various stations run as 'hospitals' for children's teddy bears and are designed as a hands-on experience that allows children to better understand healthcare, reduce medical associated fears, and inspire them to pursue higher education. Our organization offers allied-health students opportunities to practice working with children and experience teaching health care. Students learn important pediatric communication skills, such as building rapport and using child-friendly language. Volunteers diffuse complex medical information and explain important health questions to participating children. Vision In our Teddy Bear Hospital mock hospital sessions, children will bring a beloved teddy (or are loaned one) and treat their teddy bears with empathy, learn about patient care, and discover careers in medicine. Through our team, we strive for creating a fun and relaxed atmosphere to create a positive experience in medicine. With these interactions, TBH aims to ease any fears and anxieties concerning doctors' visits, hospital settings, and/or medical procedures. Objectives 1.

Teens for Screens at UCLA

As part of efforts to come up with a new model for community outreach about breast cancer, UCSF's San Francisco Cancer Initiative Breast Cancer Task Force (SFCAN) discussed the idea of Teens for Screens (T4S) in 2018. In the course of numerous meetings and collaboration with community-based organizations geared toward the underserved population of San Francisco, the concept of creating a sustainable model of outreach to raise awareness of breast cancer among youth to educate their families and communities was developed. In addition to the support of SFCAN through the funding and resources they provided, the T4S pilot program would not have been possible without the leadership of Dr. Laura Fejerman, Dr. Ana Velasquez, Tania Dugatkin, and UCSF staff. We recognize them for the time, passion, support, and dedication they have contributed to T4S. In the Fall of 2019, T4S launched and empowered high school students with information to advocate for breast cancer screenings and healthy behaviors among their friends, families, and communities. In this vein, Teens for Screens at UCLA has adopted this model with a twist. To implement this model, UCLA Teens for Screens seeks to train undergraduate students as breast cancer educators to have them educate middle and high schoolers locally either in-person or remotely. As part of our outreach efforts, we aim to partner with high schools with high populations of underserved groups, such as low-income students and minorities, to provide them with information about breast cancer and the importance of screening. We also aim to provide one-on-one mentorship, with a culminating capstone project at the end of each program. As we continue this journey behind Teens for Screens, we hope that we can spread awareness about an often under-discussed, yet important issue.

The Giving Craft

Our club creates a space for individuals to craft and donate handmade items, including crochet, paintings, drawings, embroidery, felt art, and similar crafts, to healthcare facilities such as hospitals, clinics, and hospice care that cannot afford many decorations. Some hospitals may also not allow flowers in certain units or patients staying at inpatient facilities may not have visitors who could decorate their room/visit them often. However, research shows that various forms of art can improve patient outcomes and alleviate stress. By offering these handcrafted creations, we aim to provide comfort where traditional gifts like flowers are restricted. Additionally, the club promotes healthy hobbies and relaxation among students, fostering creativity while contributing to patient care and enhancing the environments of healthcare.

THYRAISE at UCLA

THYRAISE, short for Thyroid Awareness, Innovation, Support, and Education, is a novel organization dedicated to increasing awareness and advocating for thyroid syndromes and cancers across Los Angeles and ultimately nationally. Central to its mission is the enhancement of patient awareness concerning the critical need for transparency with physicians about hormonal supplements. To fulfill this objective, THYRAISE has a strategic plan consisting of several key actions: First, the organization intends to collaborate with endocrinologists throughout the LA area to initiate clinical studies and surveys aimed at assessing patients' trust in their doctors, particularly regarding discussions about hormonal supplements. This initiative is designed to identify gaps in communication and foster a culture of openness and informed consent in patient care. Secondly, THYRAISE is set to develop a range of educational materials, including brochures, intended for distribution within endocrinology offices across Los Angeles. These materials are intended to educate patients on thyroid conditions, treatments, and risks of Over-The-Counter (OTC) thyroid supplements, providing them with the knowledge to engage in meaningful dialogues with their healthcare providers about the use of hormonal supplements. Lastly, THYRAISE plans to engage with policymakers and California state representatives, advocating for the enactment of legislation or directives that would enforce stricter regulations on the approval and accessibility of Over-The-Counter (OTC) thyroid supplements. Club members will also be active in the thyroidology community, attending events such as the USC Thyroid Day. Through these concerted efforts, THYRAISE aims to make a significant impact in the realm of thyroid health, focused on the causes of transparency, patient empowerment, and regulatory reform.

UMMA Volunteer Project (UVP)

UMMA Volunteer Project (UVP) was founded in 1996 as a volunteer source for the UMMA Community Clinic, a free health clinic established by UCLA graduate and undergraduate students to serve the residents of the South Los Angeles community. Since its opening, UMMA Clinic has served over 30,000 patients, 90% of whom are below the poverty line. UVP has been assisting UMMA Clinic since it's inception and played a crucial role in the clinic's early success by providing a steady group of volunteers to assist at the clinic. UVP allows students the opportunity to volunteer at health fairs, giving them first-hand exposure to the health care field in one of the most underserved regions in the nation. Volunteers also help at the many events in which UMMA Clinic participates, including the Hawthorne Health Fair, Tax Day, Fremont Farmers Market, and Humanitarian Day. To further address the needs of the community, UVP is committed to providing preventative health education to students and patients in South Los Angeles. UVP has established weekly, after-school health and physical education courses at elementary and middle schools in South LA with the aim of promoting healthy living. As part of these courses, students are taught lessons on nutrition and the importance of healthy eating, as well as other health topics. Following each lesson plan are fun and interactive outdoor activities to get the students moving, with the ultimate goal of inspiring a lifelong enjoyment of physical activity. UVP also runs a weekly program for high schoolers in South LA where students learn about contemporary public health issues and present a capstone project on a topic of their choice. The program aims to develop students' research and critical thinking skills and inspire the next generation of leaders in healthcare. In addition to the youth, UVP also aims to educate the adult population of South Los Angeles about various health disorders through the Preventative Health Initiative (PHI). Every week, UVP volunteers spread awareness of initial warning signs, disease prevention, and healthy life-style practices while passing out free food and resources to UMMA Clinic patients and local community members at the Fremont Free Food Fair. These efforts are aimed to curb the prevalence of common health disorders including diabetes, hypertension, and other prevalent conditions. Due to the current pandemic, the Black and communities of color we serve are facing increased discrimination and lack of access to proper care or resources. With our connection to the UMMA Clinic we are hoping to address this prejudice in providing a health clinic that can provide for them without bias towards their race, income or zip code. Join us in making this change.
