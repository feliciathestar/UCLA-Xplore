Health Law Society

The mission of the Health Law Society (HLS) is to raise the profile of health law issues at the school and to provide exposure to the field and opportunities for students interested in studying and pursuing careers in health law. Healthcare is a highly regulated industry, and with the new health reform bill, the law concerning healthcare is growing and changing. This means that health law is an exciting area of study as well as a great field for lawyers to enter into. Reflecting this trend, UCLA has been adding to its health law curriculum with courses offered by Professor Hoffman in Health Insurance Reform and Health Law and Policy. We would like to supplement this curriculum by bringing in experts to discuss various components of health law and enlighten students on relevant issues. We will also strive to enhance the employment prospects for students interested in health law by bringing potential employers to network with students. HLS will heighten the profile of UCLA as an attractive choice for prospective students in health law and will strengthen connections between the school and the legal community.

LSIJ believes that every person in this country—regardless of when or how they arrived here; the crimes they have been charged with or convicted of; their race, ethnicity, skin color, sexual orientation or gender identity; and their educational background or military service—deserves to live free from deportation, prison, and police violence on land stolen from Indigenous peoples. When we say police, we mean all private and state law enforcement agents who use violence to coerce—including ICE and private contractors running immigration prisons.

Based upon evaluations from these judges, advocates with cumulative scores placing them among the top 40% of all advocates participating in the Fall and Spring competitions become members of the Moot Court Honors Program. The top four advocates from each side of the Spring Honors Competition (eight total) are chosen to argue in the Roscoe Pound Semi-Finals. The two best oral advocates from each side (four total) go on to argue the case before three of the nation's most distinguished jurists in the annual Roscoe Pound Tournament. The top twelve students who compete in both the Fall and Spring competition are named Distinguished Advocates. The top nineteen students who compete in both the Fall and Spring are eligible for various national competitions.?

People’s Parity Project (PPP) is a movement of law students and attorneys organizing for a democratized legal system which empowers working people and opposes subordination in any form. Together, we are dismantling a profession that upholds corporate power and building in its place a legal system that reflects our values of justice, equity, and solidarity. PPP is committed to unrigging the civil legal system, focusing on the role lawyers and the legal profession have played in rigging that system. The organization’s focus is on righting lawyer-created harms and supporting the communities most impacted by those harms. PPP’s work is motivated by a desire to create a new kind of law student and lawyering: a legal culture that prioritizes true justice over prestige and what is right over what is profitable.

Pilipinx Pre-law Pipeline

The Pilipinx Pre-Law Pipeline (3P) has a vision rooted in kapwa. Kapwa is the shared mentality that “I am because you are”. It is a cornerstone of normative Pilipinx thought that encapsulates the sense of shared identity within the Pilipinx community. We aim to strengthen this sense of kapwa to combat the inequalities within the legal field and to highlight the importance of increasing Pilipinx representation in legal professions.

QTPOCC

The Queer and Trans People of Color Collective is an intentional space by and for people of color in the queer community on the law school campus. We specifically welcome people who identify as a racial minority under the LGBTQIA umbrella. Although UCLA has a true reputation of inclusivity for racial minorities and queer folks, we are focused on creating a space for those who are at the intersection of being a queer or trans person of color. As QTPOC, we are already minorities in almost every space, but the legal field in particular highlights our lack of representation. The particular adversity we face allows very few of us to clear the hurdles of entry to this powerful institution. As we overcome these challenges and more of us enter the legal profession, we established the Queer and Trans People of Color Collective to provide a welcome home for those who come after us so that we may work together to carry our community forward.
