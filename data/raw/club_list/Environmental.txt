Brallium@UCLA

In response to the discomfort and health concerns associated with traditional undergarments, consumers have increasingly sought alternatives that provide both comfort and functionality. While nipple covers have emerged as a viable solution, the current market offerings often lack diversity and fail to address individual needs effectively. Recognizing this gap, Brallium is committed to advance our current prototype of sustainable nipple covers and manufacture on a larger scale for UCLA students and beyond.

Our activities encompass campus-wide initiatives to mobilize students, as well as participation in protests and marches alongside local organizations like LA Animal Save and Mercy for Animals. A large part of our activities is our engagement in corporate campaigning, striving for policy changes and ethical practices within businesses to ensure the humane treatment of animals across various industries. BOS is a member organization in the Animal Welfare Alliance, and complements the mission of AWA, working to improve animal welfare primarily through direct action and pressure.

California Public Interest Research Group

CALPIRG is a statewide, student directed, public interest advocacy organization and is funded through student fees. Our organizers and advocates train students on how to run effective campaigns to solve some of society's most urgent issues through policy. Our primary mission is to encourage student power and activism and to serve as a resource to all student organizations. Last year we had several significant accomplishments. We were the group that passed SB100, one of the strongest climate change laws in the country which committed the entire state of CA to 100% clean electricity by 2045. And in the 2018 election, CALPIRG students across the state registered 6,000 students to vote and contacted 500,000 students to get them to the polls. Read more about our accomplishments here: https://calpirgstudents.org/recent-victories/ If you are a part of or affiliated with a student group that would like to collaborate or seek assistance from CALPIRG, please email our organizer or chapter leadership directly! We are excited about the upcoming quarter, and encourage all interested students to apply for an internship. Join our chapter and you will gain skills and experience necessary to make a difference in the world, as well as meet an amazing group of intelligent, positive, and hardworking people. (We also have a LOT of fun doing it!!)

Environmental Medicine Club

This organization aims to explore the mutual effects of environmental and human health on one another and their impact on the world at large. The club will include initiatives to spread awareness regarding the intersection of climate change and medicine and explore questions such as natural disasters have downstream impacts and affect patient care in unprecedented ways, how the medical industry contributes to climate change and pollution, how environmental concerns such as pollution affects noncommunicable diseases. As environmental issues and climate change intensify, their effects on human health will continue to grow. While these issues are intimately linked, they are under addressed so this club will seek to raise awareness of issues of how public health and environmental issues are linked and brainstorm solutions.

We believe that studying the way other countries deal with the sustainability issues that affect us here at home will provide distinctive insights on how we can tackle them. After a year of research, we travel out of Los Angeles to gain first-hand exposure to other unique cities, produce a research paper with our results, and record the whole process for other UCLA students.

Plant Futures at UCLA

Increasingly, young adults are recognizing the broad based potential of a plant-centric food system to (i) address the climate crisis directly and urgently, (ii) prevent and heal diet-related chronic diseases, and (iii) ease nutrition insecurity. Plant Futures Initiative aims to meet students at an opportune moment in their lives, helping them to become enlightened eaters and advocates for positive food systems transformation, and bridging education, advocacy, and right livelihood. Plant Futures has two purposes. 1. To educate others and increase awareness about the diverse facets and drivers of the plant-centric food systems including social justice, health benefits and environmental sustainability. 2. Partner with other organizations both on and off campus to facilitate learning and work towards implementing some changes towards a plant based food solution. The goal of Plant Futures is to build a community of students who are ethical leaders, systems thinkers and effective advocates for a plant-centric future. These students will have access to the Plant Futures network where they will ideally receive opportunities to meet with and work with companies and organizations beyond campus who are currently working on different plant based solutions. This organization is part of the larger organization of Plant Futures.
