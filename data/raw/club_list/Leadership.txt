Bruin Experiment

Founded by Daniel Haiem and Katie Mowris in the summer of 2015, the mission of The Bruin Experiment is to inspire scientific curiosity in the underserved youth through the orchestration of self-initiated science fairs. By providing a medium where students can interact in a fun, safe and educational manner, we aim to encourage them to view science as more than intimidating textbooks. During the fall and winter quarters, we visit selected Title I schools over 15 weeks to help our students guide their projects. We then invite the students to UCLA for a science fair in the spring quarter, where they may showcase their findings to proud parents, fellow students, and faculty.

Our Purpose and Mission Statement: We are a 501(c) Not-for-Profit organization that focuses on the retention and matriculation of Latino males in higher education. We seek to advance Latino males into academic scholars, community leaders, and prepare them for the professional world post-college. We shall achieve this by instilling the values represented by our three pillars: Academic Excellence, Community Service and Social Interaction. Through our three pillars, we are able to push our members to achieve “El Nuevo Hombre” which focuses on breaking down the most damaging cultural stereotypes and the machista mindset, by promoting vulnerability and openness. Three Pillars: Academic Excellence: strives to achieve and maintain maximal effort and performance in an institution of higher education. We pride ourselves in assuring that all members receive the tools for them to succeed in and out of the classroom. These resources include a test-bank, book-bank, study locations, tutoring services and while also providing directions for our members to adequate school resources that will also aid them on their academic journey. Community Service: engages in acts to uplift the local community as part of an effort to matriculate Latinos into higher education. Our goal is to provide back to our communities and to help inspire the next generation of Latinos to attend schools of higher education. This can be done through our partnerships with other community organizations and through our own sponsored events. Social Interaction: promotes professionalism and Hermandad through internal and external events. We hope that through these events, members are able to gain an opportunity to become better assimilated in society post-graduation. Members will learn the importance of building relationships and leveraging relationships in networking to build powerful lasting friendships while advancing professional careers.

Honors Fellows at UCLA

The Honors Fellows is a vibrant, student-led organization within the UCLA College Honors program, dedicated to fostering a vibrant and supportive community among honors students. Our mission is to enhance the academic and professional development of our members while creating a welcoming and inclusive environment. We achieve this through a variety of initiatives, including academic and professional workshops tailored to the unique needs and interests of honors students. These workshops cover a wide range of topics, from research skills and thesis writing to career planning and networking strategies, providing valuable resources and guidance to help students excel in their studies and future endeavors. In addition to academic support, we place a strong emphasis on social engagement and community building. Our social events offer a fun and relaxed setting for honors students to connect, share experiences, and forge lasting friendships. These gatherings, ranging from informal meetups to larger celebrations, play a crucial role in creating a sense of belonging and camaraderie within the College Honors program. Recognizing the importance of accessible and personalized support, we also offer regular office hours. These sessions provide an opportunity for students to seek advice, ask questions, and discuss any challenges they may be facing with our experienced fellows. Whether it's academic concerns, personal issues, or just a friendly chat, our office hours are a valuable resource for students seeking guidance and support. Furthermore, as student ambassadors to the UCLA Honors Programs, we play a vital role in representing the interests and needs of honors students. We serve as a bridge between the student body and the program administration, advocating for policies and initiatives that enhance the honors experience. Our involvement in this capacity ensures that the voices of honors students are heard and that the program continues to evolve in ways that benefit its members. The Honors Fellows is more than just an organization; it's a community of motivated and ambitious individuals committed to supporting each other and making the most of their honors experience at UCLA. Through our academic and professional workshops, social events, office hours, and advocacy efforts, we strive to provide a comprehensive support system that empowers honors students to achieve their full potential and build meaningful connections within the College Honors program.

Lambda Chi Alpha Fraternity

"The objective of Lambda Chi Alpha is the establishment of a brotherhood for the cultivation of good will among men, the fostering of the highest ideal of patriotism, the acquirement of sound learning, and the observance to the laws of god." This direct quote from our associate member ceremony is a good summary of what most, if not all, brothers would consider our mission statement to be. The brothers of Lambda Chi want to create a home for those seeking adventure, development, and mental fortitude. We believe every word of our creed, "We have faith in Lambda Chi Alpha, and passion for its welfare." This passion, led by strong leadership, will make its name on campus. And in doing so, Lambda Chi Alpha will attract the men of UCLA who believe that fraternity is for brotherhood and personal development.

This organization pioneers an in-person and virtual collaborative environment that connects various student cohorts, fostering stronger relationships among students and faculty within the health policy management department. This effort is especially critical given the predominantly remote format of our program, which naturally restricts face-to-face networking opportunities. MHASA is dedicated to collating and voicing course feedback collectively and devising tailored professional development opportunities for our members, who typically balance their studies with full-time professional commitments. Our goal is to enhance their academic achievements and equip them with the leadership skills necessary for their future success.

Moot Court Honors Program

The Moot Court Honors Program is an intramural competition open to second and third year law students. The Moot Court Honors Program is dedicated to promoting appellate advocacy by UCLA Law students, fostering intramural competition, and supporting and promoting the UCLA School of Law through external competition. Students brief and argue a case created especially for the competition by members of the Moot Court Executive Board. The focus is on appellate advocacy, and the judges consist primarily of local members of the bench and bar. Competitors receive scores based 50% on their brief and 50% on their oral scores. Based upon evaluations from these judges, advocates with cumulative scores placing them among the top 40% of all advocates participating in the Fall and Spring competitions become members of the Moot Court Honors Program. The top four advocates from each side of the Spring Honors Competition (eight total) are chosen to argue in the Roscoe Pound Semi-Finals. The two best oral advocates from each side (four total) go on to argue the case before three of the nation's most distinguished jurists in the annual Roscoe Pound Tournament. The top twelve students who compete in both the Fall and Spring competition are named Distinguished Advocates. The top nineteen students who compete in both the Fall and Spring are eligible for various national competitions.?

Pilipino Council of the Mabuhay Collective (PCMC)

Founded in 2009, the Pilipino Council of the Mabuhay Collective (PCMC) is a council of students that support, facilitate, and unite the Pilipinx and Pilipinx-American community at UCLA. The Mabuhay Collective is comprised of 15 Pilipinx student organizations based at UCLA: Anakbayan at UCLA, Kabalikat Kore, Kappa Psi Epsilon, Pilipino Recruitment and Enrichment Program, Pilipino Transfer Student Partnership, Pilipinos for Community Health, Pilipinos in Engineering and Science, Pilipinx Living Learning Community, Pilipinx Pre-Law Pipeline, Samahang Modern, Samahang Pilipino, Samahang Pilipino Advancing Community Empowerment, Samahang Pilipino Cultural Night, Samahang Pilipino Education and Retention, and Tinig Choral. The Council, which consists of co-equal Cabinet and Senate branches, brings together its 15 organizations and 900+ students. PCMC is founded on five pillars - academia, culture, politics, profession, and society. These ideas underpin the PCMC motto: “Magkasama Bilang Isa, Mga Tao,” or “Together As One, The People.” In addition to serving as the supporting body of the Collective, PCMC plans events such as Pilipino Welcome Reception, Pilipino-American History Month Celebration, MabuFest, and Pilipino Farewell Reception. PCMC also facilitates the Pilipinos Advancing Leadership Success (PALS) internship on a quarterly basis, allowing student interns to shadow current Cabinet members, participate fully in meetings, and contribute to event planning. PALS interns are able to learn more about topics such as the Pilipinx community at UCLA and beyond, Pilipino history, mental health practices, and outlooks from an Asian-American perspective.

Reformed University Fellowship

RUF is a Christian fellowship comprised of UCLA students, seeking to thoughtfully and respectfully communicate the love and truth of Jesus Christ. Through community, prayer, worship, and teaching, RUF endeavors to help students mature in their understanding of the Christian faith as expressed in the Reformed theological tradition. Though RUF is Presbyterian in affiliation, it welcomes students from all walks of life and religious backgrounds. Moreover, an atmosphere and community of respectful and honest discussion is desired, as students explore the Christian faith and wrestle with how that faith integrates into all of life; that is, RUF seeks to be a servant of the university as it ministers to the whole student: emotionally, socially, academically, and spiritually.

Most importantly, our chapters and colonies provide the support for excellence that is sorely needed today on campuses. That brotherhood comes in a wide and diverse variety of shapes, sizes, forms, colors, and fashions, but it reflects the concept of the Helping Hand -- that the most important duty that we have is to assist others, especially in time of need. Young people today are in need of that support, perhaps more than ever before. Theta Chi fraternity squarely meets that need.

USAC Internal Vice President's Office

We seek to serve you, the students! As the representative organization for over 1000+ student organizations at UCLA, we are accordingly interested in promoting the varied interests of this diverse body. We recognize that this objective may seem formidable, ambitious even. After all, it is difficult to represent such a disparate array of clubs, teams and organizations. However, rather than bemoan such a daunting task, we are instead committed to embracing this immense diversity; which paints our campus in different strokes and which allows us both to appreciate the uniqueness within ourselves as well as in others. Moreover, we do not see UCLA as an isolated outpost in the greater Los Angeles area, disconnected and aloof from its surrounding environment. Instead, we see the two entities as active partners in a fruitful relationship that is continuing to evolve in significant and important ways. Thus, not only do we hope to advocate student engagement on campus, but we also hope to extend that engagement to the community of Los Angeles. As citizens and students of this active, moving city, we must recognize our own interdependence, our own parallel currents; we must become more conscious of the direction in which we are moving; and the Office of the Internal Vice President is committed to doing this.

USAC Transfer Student Representative

The Office of the Transfer Student Representative is one of 15 offices of the Undergraduate Student Association (USA). The role of the elected Transfer Student Representative is to be the voice that represents the undergraduate transfer student population to the USA Council. The office is meant to address the collective needs of the transfer student body and ensure those needs are met by student government and by the administration. Among other steps towards transfer justice, the Office of the TSR appoints transfers to campus-wide committees, presents Transfer Awareness Trainings, co-hosts Transfer Transitions, lobbies for transfer legislation at the state and national level, and works with other UCLA transfers and transfers across the UC to advocate for a more equitable university experience for transfers. This role was created in 2014 as a result of advocacy by the Transfer Leadership Coalition and stands as a symbol of the power transfers have at UCLA.
