Judo is best known for its throwing techniques but also includes numerous techniques for controlling an opponent while on the ground.

This class will foster general fitness and well-being, and develop real-world safety and self-defense strategies, all while improving physical fitness, flexibility, strength, coordination, and agility.

Swim

Hello! We are California's first Club Swimming team! We train Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from 6:00 to 7:30 p.m. at the Student Activities Center Pool in the heart of campus. Our longtime coach, Mike Santo, is very experienced but still maintains a chill, fun environment at practice. He gives us the sets to swim during practice and alters them according to each swimmer's skill levels. Our team enthusiastically accepts swimmers of all skill levels, from swimmers who decide to join just for recreation, to swimmers who want to qualify to compete at Club Swim Nationals in April. In terms of meets, we usually have around two meets per quarter, with one travel meet and one home meet at Spieker Aquatics Center (where the Division I NCAA team competes!). All of our meets and practices are optional, but team members are highly encouraged to participate in order to bond with the team, represent UCLA, and have fun in the water. We will be having free practices during Week 1 to allow new members to get a feel for the inclusive vibes and relaxed energy of our team before deciding to register. The best way to keep up with our team is by liking our Facebook page (UCLA Club Swimming) or following us on Instagram (@uclaclubswimming). Team dues are $70 per quarter, or $180 for the whole year, making swimming one of the least expensive club sports teams.
