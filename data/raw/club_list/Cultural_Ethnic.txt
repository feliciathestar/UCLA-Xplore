American Indian Student Association

AISA stands as a welcoming association open to all UCLA students, although American Indians constitute less than 1% of the student body nationwide. We have cultivated a robust and supportive community that nurtures American Indian, Alaskan Native, and First Nation students in their educational pursuits at UCLA. Within the Native Bruin community, students unite to advance education and cultural understanding. Together, we challenge misconceptions surrounding American Indian art, language, history, and lifestyles. Our strength lies in our diverse backgrounds; every member enriches our community with unique perspectives, fostering a vibrant environment. At AISA, we've pioneered student-led outreach initiatives like American Indian Recruitment (AIR) and Retention of American Indians Now! (RAIN!), both headquartered in the Student Activities Center. These projects are tailored to empower Native individuals in their higher education journeys. We also host significant events annually, including Native American Heritage Week, the Youth Conference/Basketball Tournament, and the UCLA PowWow. Additionally, we pay homage to the Gabrieleño peoples, the original custodians of the Los Angeles Greater Basin and Southern Channel Islands, acknowledging their enduring connection to the land.

Backgammon Club at UCLA

The Backgammon Club is going to be dedicated to forming a campus community of players who share a passion for this ancient and intellectually stimulating game. Whether an experienced player or completely new to backgammon, this club will offer an inclusive environment for learning and mastering the rules, strategies, and subtleties of the game. Backgammon, a game with over 5,000 years of history, not only serves as an amazing tradition into various cultures but also as a mental challenge that sharpens critical thinking, strategic planning, and decision-making. Its unique blend of skill and chance makes it an excellent tool for developing problem-solving skills under pressure, improve cognitive abilities, enhance pattern recognition, and boost resilience. The club will serve as a platform to connect with fellow students across campus who share an interest in the game, making it easier to find playing partners and form friendships. For people new to the game, there will be tutorials online and in-person when requested. We will hold regular game nights, workshops, and strategy sessions designed to help both beginners and advanced players improve their skills. Additionally, the club will organize friendly competitions and tournaments, offering members the opportunity to engage in healthy rivalry while also improving and enjoying this historic cultural tradition. The club will have backgammon players with years of experience, who are going to be ready to help other club members while enjoying the game themselves.

Genocide Relief, Awareness, and Community Education (GRACE)

The Genocide Relief, Awareness, and Community Education (GRACE) Organization is committed to preventing, addressing, and seeking justice for all forms of mass atrocities targeting ethnic and religious groups. In a world desensitized by digital media, GRACE attempts to combat the widespread ignorance of genocides by organizing events featuring speakers, survivors, and experts to share their stories and educate UCLA students. Each month, the organization will focus on a specific genocide, dedicating the month to lectures and presentations that explore the culture of the affected group, the nature of the genocide, and the pursuit of justice. Additionally, GRACE will promote donation efforts, educational resources, and petitions. While we recognize that such initiatives cannot resolve the larger issues at play, fostering a passionate student-led community is a crucial step that GRACE undertakes toward addressing the inaction perpetuating genocides worldwide.

Sikh Student Association at UCLA

Sikh Student Association provides a platform for all students to excel in a variety of different ways: academics, spirituality, community service and social life. In scholarship we provide academic resources, mentor mentee programs, and internship opportunities. Amongst our members, we provide intense study guides for classes. This furthers our efforts in making each member feel welcome; thus, establishing a safe space in which it is possible to communicate thoughts and have an open discussion. We also co-program with many other South Asian Organizations on campus in order to provide students with other outlets, professional and cultural. In spirituality we have Kirtan nights, set prayer times, meditation, Gurbani and Punjabi classes, and debates on the faith. Additionally, our association provides the students of UCLA with the opportunity to engage in unique community service efforts such as Sikh Relief (who provide assistance by fighting the drug problem in Punjab, help Sikh Political Prisoners, provide relief in Nepal or anywhere else there is a natural disaster) as well as work with the United Sikh Movement to offer langar (free food) to individuals that lack these resources (i.e. Skid Row, Riverside, and other regions in LA). Lastly, we make sure our members feel at home and enjoy the beautiful city of LA by hosting mixers, bonfires, beach trips, hikes, movie nights, ice skating and a range of other fun social activities. From day one, we hope to be efficient with our professional lives but at the same time enjoy our college years through Seva, Simran (prayer and mediation), and Kirt (working diligently). We are partnered with the United Sikh Movement, the official link between SSAs across California, to constantly expand and connect with the Sikh sangat at large.

Underrepresented Graduate Students in Psychology

Underrepresented Graduate Students in Psychology (UGSP) is a group dedicated to supporting and advocating for psychology students from racial, linguistic, geographic, or socioeconomic backgrounds that are currently underrepresented in graduate education. UGSP is designed to provide valuable social support to these students whom may otherwise find it difficult to pursue their graduate studies. Through activities, mentorship, and community outreach, we hope to provide a community that encourages the potential and promise of those from underrepresented groups. By promoting and improving multicultural training in psychology, we hope to not only increase ethnic minority student recruitment, retention, and graduation but also improve intergroup relations within our department. UGSP operates with the following branches: UGSP Brown Bag Committee This committee organizes a lecture series that is open to all graduate students. These talks are given by faculty members and post-doctoral students from underrepresented backgrounds or whose research focuses on diversity issues. Each Brown Bag lecture includes both a research presentation and a career development component. This speaker series allows graduate students to network with prominent faculty members from underrepresented groups, hopefully fostering a sense social connectedness and community within the Psychology Department. UGSP Undergraduate Outreach Committee This committee organizes panels for undergraduate students to learn about various aspects of the graduate student experience. We hope to galvanize interest in graduate school by offering examples of successful underrepresented students from their own university. We also hope that this will provide undergraduates with the opportunity to connect with graduate students so they feel comfortable asking questions about diversity in graduate school. UGSP High School Outreach Committee As members of underrepresented groups, we find it imperative to give back to our communities through teaching, education, and service. UGSP will target high schools in low-income neighborhoods and will hold lectures for both parents and students about getting into college. UGSP Transfer Outreach Committee This committee is dedicated to providing resources and improving the experiences of the diverse group of transfer students at UCLA. A central goal of this committee is to serve transfers as they navigate their undergraduate experience and provide tools and information as they set future goals by creating/hosting events and building community between undergraduate and graduate students. UGSP Social Committee The Social Committee plans and coordinates various events each year, typically off campus. Our goal in organizing these events is to foster a sense of community among UGSP members. It is a chance for students to interact with people that come from diverse backgrounds who share similar experiences.

In the process, we will learn more about our ancestral origins and traditions, develop a sense of pride and unique identity, and assist others in the community through educational empowerment. In doing so, we aim to promote a positive image to other Americans about the oft-misrepresented and overlooked Afghan people and their heart-warming traditions.

United Khmer Students

United Khmer Students is a student-run organization dedicated to fostering a positive environment for Khmer students and Khmer culture at UCLA. The club serves to act as an active voice for the the greater Cambodian community and to advocate for its relevant issues. Due to the lacking representation of Khmer people, UKS feels itself to be a necessary component within the UCLA community. UKS not only provides a social environment for Khmer and non-Khmer students alike, but works towards creating a politically and culturally active space. The club is consistent with cultivating cultural education and traditions for its general membership as well as providing leadership opportunities for members to be involved within their communities.
