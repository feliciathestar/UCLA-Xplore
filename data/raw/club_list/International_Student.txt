Iranian Graduate and Professional Association (IGPA)

The Iranian Graduate and Professional Association (IGPA) is dedicated to serving Iranian graduate and professional scholars across the UCLA campus. We estimate that there are approximately 500 Iranian graduate and professional scholars at UCLA, spanning various fields including medical, STEM, and non-STEM disciplines. Our primary focus is to foster a sense of community among these Iranian scholars, many of whom are thousands of miles away from their families and friends. We achieve this by organizing events that celebrate Iranian culture and scheduling both professional and informal gatherings where scholars can connect with their peers, seek guidance, and build a professional network. These gatherings are particularly beneficial during the Fall quarter, as newcomers can obtain helpful academic and non-academic information. For a more detailed overview of our group's foundation and objectives, please refer to our constitution. Additionally, our Instagram profile (@igpaatucla) offers insights into our past events and provides updates on upcoming ones.
