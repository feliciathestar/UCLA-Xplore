Master of Healthcare Administration Student Association (MHASA) at UCLA

The Master of Healthcare Administration Student Association (MHASA) is a student-led initiative explicitly crafted for the health administration graduate student body at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health. This organization pioneers an in-person and virtual collaborative environment that connects various student cohorts, fostering stronger relationships among students and faculty within the health policy management department. This effort is especially critical given the predominantly remote format of our program, which naturally restricts face-to-face networking opportunities. MHASA is dedicated to collating and voicing course feedback collectively and devising tailored professional development opportunities for our members, who typically balance their studies with full-time professional commitments. Our goal is to enhance their academic achievements and equip them with the leadership skills necessary for their future success.
