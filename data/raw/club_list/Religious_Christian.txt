Chosen Campus Ministry

We are a non-denominational christian club focused on helping students grow in their spiritual life and learning what it looks like to follow Jesus through the bible. Each quarter many students come and study the bible with us and gain an experience like no other. They find spiritual revival, enlightenment and find the purpose of their existence. We believe that the bible calls us to be excellent in all areas of life and that includes our education. We encourage students to be disciplined in their studies and keep an excellent work ethic as they study the bible and attend their classes. These bible studies have changed the lives of so many individuals. We've had people come addicted to drugs, plagued with anxiety and stress, hurt emotionally, with no hope and the list goes on and on. We help them see that God has a plan for their life and show them what a life with God could look like. So many have seen true happiness and hope for the very first time and their lives are forever changed. Outside of personal bible studies we offer club meetings throughout the week as well as a Sunday service with the home church we are apart of. This gives students a valuable sense of belonging within a community full of sold out believers focused on taking care of each other and display the love of Christ. We do not discriminate anyone but welcome all who want to study the bible and get to know Jesus. We invite all types of people from all different types backgrounds and upbringings to check out what were all about!

Coptic Orthodox Christian Club

The Coptic Church is about 2,000 years old - it is enriched with knowledge and tradition taken all the way from St. Mark, an apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ. St. Mark ended up being a martyr for our church, as so have been most of our preachers and believers, but he did spread the faith to us and we are here to learn more about it as well as spread that knowledge to all others! The purpose of our club is to reach out to all students, no matter what religion or ethnicity at UCLA. We exist so that we may provide a means by which the Orthodox community can grow spiritually. Our goal is to make sure that we all grow stronger in knowledge, faith, unity, and love. We do so by providing fun activities, spiritual meetings, prayer meetings, Bible studies, community service, etc. It is not just limited to Copts, but to everyone who is seeking God and would like to find Him; we welcome questions and curiosity! Please ask and contact us if you would like to learn more!

CCM is a Christian ministry with the mission statement of “crossing collegians into Christ’s community.” We also share the good news of the Gospel that Jesus died for us and bore our sin so that we could have eternal life (John 3:16). We emphasize our small groups and strongly encourage all members to be a part of one to grow closer with their brothers and sisters in Christ and to grow in their walk with God. As a parachurch organization, our goal is to get everyone connected with a local church so that even after college, the students will still be a part of a Christian community.

Latinos are the future of the United States! We’re a fast-growing and young community. Right now 1 out of every 5 kids born in this country is Latino. And more Latino/a students are enrolling in college than at any other time in history! For us, it’s about more than numbers. We believe that God has a special destiny for Latinos. He is going to use Latinos to change this nation and change the world. And so we exist to help raise up a generation of leaders from the Latino and Hispanic communities to change the world!

Klesis Christian Fellowship

Klesis is a UCLA campus ministry that meets weekly to study the Bible and build lasting friendships. College is the perfect time to explore the big questions like, “Does God exist?” and “What am I here for?” At Klesis, you’ll find a safe space to ask these questions and seek answers alongside other students. Throughout the week we hang out, eat lots of good food, study together, go on fun trips, and just “do life” together. Klesis is Greek for divine calling or invitation. It’s God’s invitation to a relationship with Him. College is full of invitations, but this is a special one. So whether you are a Christian who wants to grow in your faith, or just curious about what Christianity is all about, we invite you to join us!
