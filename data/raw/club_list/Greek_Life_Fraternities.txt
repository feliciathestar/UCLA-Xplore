Beta Delta Alpha Fraternity

Beta Delta Alpha is the first Arab fraternity in the United States. We are the only fraternity in the United States that unites its members under the principles of leadership, character, and service alongside the grand principles of Arab culture. The purpose of Beta Delta Alpha is to unite its members in a brotherhood based upon the bonds of sincere and lasting friendship, to stimulate one another in the pursuit of knowledge and success, to promote the moral and social culture of its members, and to develop plans for guidance and unity in action. Most of all, this fraternity seeks to promote respect and loyalty to one’s heritage and never forget the culture of our ancestors. We wish to show the diversity in culture that exists within the Arab World and the ways in which Arab men have impacted Arab culture, society, and history and continue to be active representatives of Arab culture around the world. Furthermore, we aspire to break down the cultural barriers against Arabs within our brotherhood and among our immediate community. The fraternity is secular in nature, and thus does not endorse activities or any specific group of individuals based on ethnicity, religious beliefs, and political affiliations. We welcome any human being who wants to follow the ideals of being an Arab gentleman, regardless of whether one is Arab or not.

Gamma Zeta Alpha Fraternity, Inc.

In 1987, fifteen men came together to found what would later become known as Gamma Zeta Alpha Fraternity, Inc. -- Recognizing the difficulties facing Latinos in higher education, the founders sought to create an organization aimed at developing leadership, instilling academic scholarship, and creating an environment of support that integrated Latino heritage. After realizing that other student organizations would not be able to provide all of these to their members, the founders decided that creating a fraternity, something that was new in Latino culture, would be the best opportunity for achieving its goals. -- Our founders instilled in us the principles of Academic Excellence, through which we will encourage and support Latino males in higher education; Community Service, through which we will give back to the communities that shaped our lives; and the Maintenance of Latino Culture through Brotherhood in establishing the FIRST Latino-Based Organization on the West Coast. -- In 2000, when six gentlemen realized that other student organizations at UCLA would not be able to provide them with opportunities for personal growth, networking, and a chance to contribute meaningfully to both the UCLA campus and the surrounding community, they decided to establish a chapter of this fraternity to provide them the opportunity to achieve these goals. -- Eta Chapter prides itself on being established at the number one public university in the nation. Since it’s inception on January 15th, 2000, Eta Chapter has had a 99% graduation rate, leading to an extensive alumni network with brothers working in a range of professional fields from finance to city government, medicine, law, and everywhere in between. We are not members of this brotherhood for the short time that we are at UCLA; we are members of this brotherhood for a lifetime. -- At UCLA, we strive to uplift all our brothers and their respective communities. Having multiple brothers from diverse backgrounds, such as the undocumented, LGBTQ+, transfer, and other various historically underrepresented populations, gives us the opportunity to contribute to the betterment of each of these communities. Through a combination of brotherhood, service, and leadership development, the fraternity strives to create well-rounded individuals who are prepared to lead and inspire others to excel. -- Eta Chapter offers a supportive environment where individuals can cultivate lifelong friendships, engage in philanthropic endeavors, and participate in various social and educational activities. By upholding our core values, we play an essential role in enriching the campus community and empowering our members to make a positive impact in society. -- For more than two decades, Gamma Zeta Alpha Fraternity, Inc. at ETA Chapter has been cultivating leaders and strengthening the Latino community at UCLA. As the LARGEST, and LONGEST-STANDING Latino-Based Organization, we will continue to produce sustainability that benefits our surrounding communities here at UCLA.

Lambda Chi Alpha Fraternity

"The objective of Lambda Chi Alpha is the establishment of a brotherhood for the cultivation of good will among men, the fostering of the highest ideal of patriotism, the acquirement of sound learning, and the observance to the laws of god." This direct quote from our associate member ceremony is a good summary of what most, if not all, brothers would consider our mission statement to be. The brothers of Lambda Chi want to create a home for those seeking adventure, development, and mental fortitude. We believe every word of our creed, "We have faith in Lambda Chi Alpha, and passion for its welfare." This passion, led by strong leadership, will make its name on campus. And in doing so, Lambda Chi Alpha will attract the men of UCLA who believe that fraternity is for brotherhood and personal development.

Theta Chi Fraternity exists to serve a need for young men of character, principles and ideals to associate with each other. Our chapters and colonies are laboratories for leadership. Our undergraduates grow, mature and develop through interaction with other outstanding young men. Most importantly, our chapters and colonies provide the support for excellence that is sorely needed today on campuses. That brotherhood comes in a wide and diverse variety of shapes, sizes, forms, colors, and fashions, but it reflects the concept of the Helping Hand -- that the most important duty that we have is to assist others, especially in time of need. Young people today are in need of that support, perhaps more than ever before. Theta Chi fraternity squarely meets that need.
