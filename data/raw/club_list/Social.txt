Beta Delta Alpha Fraternity

Beta Delta Alpha is the first Arab fraternity in the United States. We are the only fraternity in the United States that unites its members under the principles of leadership, character, and service alongside the grand principles of Arab culture. The purpose of Beta Delta Alpha is to unite its members in a brotherhood based upon the bonds of sincere and lasting friendship, to stimulate one another in the pursuit of knowledge and success, to promote the moral and social culture of its members, and to develop plans for guidance and unity in action. Most of all, this fraternity seeks to promote respect and loyalty to one’s heritage and never forget the culture of our ancestors. We wish to show the diversity in culture that exists within the Arab World and the ways in which Arab men have impacted Arab culture, society, and history and continue to be active representatives of Arab culture around the world. Furthermore, we aspire to break down the cultural barriers against Arabs within our brotherhood and among our immediate community. The fraternity is secular in nature, and thus does not endorse activities or any specific group of individuals based on ethnicity, religious beliefs, and political affiliations. We welcome any human being who wants to follow the ideals of being an Arab gentleman, regardless of whether one is Arab or not.

BRASA at UCLA

The Brazilian Student Association (BRASA) is a comprehensive club that embodies academic and professional spheres as well as cultural and social domains. Our main goal is to provide an environment for the Brazilian community to interact, share experiences and bond. Still, we are also always engaging with other students interested in Brazil and its culture, constantly partnering with other cultural or business associations to expand the scope of our club. Our club, BRASA at UCLA, is actually one of the many local chapters of the BRASA international organization, a group of Brazilian students that today counts with more than 7,000 registered members over 90 universities in 50 different cities around the world. Through the North America branch, the international BRASA organizes two academic and professional conferences every year--one in São Paulo, and another one in a selected university in the US. At UCLA, we currently have more than 55 active members. Our activities mainly focus on get-togethers, social events, culinary parties, networking nights, and workshops.

BridgeUSA at UCLA

BridgeUSA at UCLA is the UCLA chapter of BridgeUSA. BridgeUSA is a youth-led 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that creates spaces on high school and college campuses for open discussion between students about political issues. Political division is one of our biggest challenges in the United States. Today’s youth are being taught that tribalism is better than unity and that having conversations across our differences is impossible. Spoiler Alert: This isn’t true! We began in 2016 at the universities of Notre Dame, CU-Boulder, and UC Berkeley in response to growing polarization on campus. Our work emphasizes the importance of empathy and understanding, ideological diversity and solution-oriented politics. By engaging America’s youth in constructive discussions, we are equipping the next generation of leaders with the skills necessary for navigating conflict, finding solutions across differences and building bridges in their communities.

The Club Sampling Club offers members the opportunity to “sample” clubs by attending collaborative introductory events throughout the year. This allows students to experience the vast amount of diverse clubs at UCLA without the commitment that is typically required of them. Members can broaden their skill set, network with other students, and enhance their overall Bruin experience.

Coptic Orthodox Christian Club

The Coptic Church is about 2,000 years old - it is enriched with knowledge and tradition taken all the way from St. Mark, an apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ. St. Mark ended up being a martyr for our church, as so have been most of our preachers and believers, but he did spread the faith to us and we are here to learn more about it as well as spread that knowledge to all others! The purpose of our club is to reach out to all students, no matter what religion or ethnicity at UCLA. We exist so that we may provide a means by which the Orthodox community can grow spiritually. Our goal is to make sure that we all grow stronger in knowledge, faith, unity, and love. We do so by providing fun activities, spiritual meetings, prayer meetings, Bible studies, community service, etc. It is not just limited to Copts, but to everyone who is seeking God and would like to find Him; we welcome questions and curiosity! Please ask and contact us if you would like to learn more!

Klesis Christian Fellowship

Klesis is a UCLA campus ministry that meets weekly to study the Bible and build lasting friendships. College is the perfect time to explore the big questions like, “Does God exist?” and “What am I here for?” At Klesis, you’ll find a safe space to ask these questions and seek answers alongside other students. Throughout the week we hang out, eat lots of good food, study together, go on fun trips, and just “do life” together. Klesis is Greek for divine calling or invitation. It’s God’s invitation to a relationship with Him. College is full of invitations, but this is a special one. So whether you are a Christian who wants to grow in your faith, or just curious about what Christianity is all about, we invite you to join us!

Pitch, Please! A Cappella

Pitch, Please! was founded in the winter of 2017 and is a co-ed, competitive a cappella group at UCLA. Our music varies widely from indie ballads to upbeat experimental-pop hits, most of which is arranged by our very own members. Our passion for a cappella has driven us to strive for bigger and better things--in 2019, we competed in ICCA, released a music video, and recorded our debut album, Made To Fly, which was nominated for three Contemporary A Cappella Recording Awards! We competed in ICCA for the second time and won 2nd place at the 2020 West Quarterfinal, also receiving the special awards of Outstanding Arrangement, Outstanding Vocal Percussion, and Outstanding Choreography. We were honored to receive special awards for Outstanding Vocal Percussion and Outstanding Choreography a second time at the 2022 ICCA West Quarterfinals, also placing as overall finalists in both the 2022 and 2023 ICCA West Quarterfinals. We love sharing our music with others, and we hope to continue performing, competing, and releasing music in the future.

The Potato Game

The Potato Game will be a campus-wide game that aims to foster new friendships while brightening up the school day. The game rules will be as follows: Several people will be assigned a "hot potato," and the game will last a certain period of time. The goal of the game is to get rid of the hot potato by the end of the time period by meeting other players in person and passing the "hot potato" on. It will be tracked via an app that we will develop, and there are several rounds. We believe that these encounters will provide a great opportunity for players to introduce themselves and bond over an active, healthy game! There will be more opportunities to connect during general meetings.

At the Warhammer club, we seek to introduce people to the world of tabletop gaming and how to properly collect and field the various armies. We'll primarily play the tabletop game Warhammer 40K 10th edition, but if there is enough interested, we can branch out into Age of Sigmar or Kill Team. In the club, we'll introduce the various factions to people, build and collect models together, and each week, host a space for people to paint/build models, discuss lore, or play games together.

Young Life College at UCLA

The purpose of the Chapter is to participate in the Young Life mission of introducing adolescents to Jesus Christ and helping them grow in their Christian faith. This Chapter achieves this purpose by offering a fun, accepting community for college students to be a part of while exploring or deepening their own Christian faith, providing opportunities for college students to engage in Young Life ministry to local middle school and high school students, and offering activities like weekly club meetings, small group Bible studies, and community service opportunities in an effort to positively impact the campus and surrounding community.
