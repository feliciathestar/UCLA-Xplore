Bruin MMA Theory

Bruin MMA Theory takes an analytical and theoretical approach to learning martial arts. Bruin MMA Theory has no physical contact or applications of any martial arts, but will look over film and analyze aspects of all martial arts to grow passion and understanding of the sport. Our aims include: uniting students who have a deep passion for mixed martial arts, increasing our collective understanding and appreciation of various martial arts (such as Judo, Jujitsu, Sambo, and Muay Thai) and their cultural backgrounds, advocating for the countless benefits of martial arts as a subject of analysis for self-defense, agility, coordination, and awareness, providing a platform for members to discuss and learn about striking and grappling techniques without any physical practice, providing members the opportunity to study fight choreography for martial arts and action films, and giving members the opportunity to analyze martial arts techniques after watching fights and write reports.

I AM CONFIDENT RESILIENCE PEER EMPOWERMENT\*

I AM Confident Resilience Peer Empowerment (CRPE). The heart and soul of confidence, resilience, and empowerment Our journey is not just about words on a page; it’s a profound commitment to transforming lives through the incredible power of self-belief, inner strength, and community support. At CRPE, our mission is clear: we are here to ignite the flame of confidence and resilience within every individual. We firmly believe these qualities are not attributes to be sought externally but are an inherent part of who we are. It’s our purpose to help you recognize, embrace, and nurture these qualities, for they are not just vital in the journey of personal growth; they are the essence of our very being. When you become a part of CRPE, you enter a world of solid support and boundless possibilities. We don’t just talk about confidence and empowerment; we live it. Our organization thrives on the power of community and unity, understanding that we become an unstoppable force when we come together with a common purpose. In our community, there’s no room for doubt or hesitation. We are catalysts for change, leaders in our own right, and beacons of empowerment lighting the way for one another. In our CRPE family, you will find a sanctuary where like-minded individuals share their journeys, dreams, aspirations, and moments of vulnerability. We understand that confidence and resilience are not merely personal attributes but the cornerstones of success and well-being. We don’t just give you the tools for growth; we hand you the keys to your potential. With knowledge, firm support, and a genuine commitment to your development, we pave the way for you to thrive, no matter what life throws. Your journey with us is about personal transformation, collective confidence, and resilience building. When you join us, you become part of a movement that refuses to be held back by challenges or setbacks. Together, we forge a path to a brighter, more confident, and resilient future. Within the CRPE community, you’ll quickly realize that you are not alone on this journey. You are part of an influential collective. The bonds you form here are not just for personal growth; they reinforce your strength. As you lean on us, you also become a source of support for others. This interconnected network of confidence, resilience, and empowerment makes CRPE unique, dynamic, and immensely powerful. We invite you to stand with us as we redefine the meaning of confidence, resilience, and empowerment. Here, it’s not just a possibility; it’s a promise. And we intend to keep that promise by working together, learning, growing, and ultimately achieving together. As we navigate the path of personal resilience, confidence, and empowerment, we celebrate the unique qualities and strengths that make each of us who we are. Confidence isn’t about becoming someone you’re not but fully embracing who you are. It’s about standing tall in your authenticity and believing in your abilities. Resilience is not about avoiding challenges; it’s about facing them head-on, learning from them, and growing stronger with each experience. The power of peer, confidence, resilience, and empowerment within CRPE extends beyond support; it’s about standing shoulder to shoulder with individuals who, like you, are committed to unlocking their full potential. It’s a safe space where you can share your struggles and victories, knowing that you are among those who understand and are here to cheer you on. Together, we take the lessons learned from our experiences and use them to build not only our resilience but the resilience of the community. We recognize that personal growth is not a solo endeavor; it’s a collective journey. By empowering one another, we multiply our impact. As we rise, we uplift others, creating a ripple effect of confidence, resilience, and empowerment that extends far beyond our individual lives. In the realm of CRPE, there’s no challenge too great, no dream too ambitious, and no obstacle too daunting. We face life’s trials confidently, knowing we have the inner strength to endure and emerge stronger. We embrace our uniqueness and celebrate our diversity because our individuality enriches our collective experience. Confidence, resilience, and empowerment are not just about pursuing individual goals but also about the greater good. We take our confidence, resilience, and empowerment beyond ourselves and channel it into the betterment of the world around us. We are leaders, not just in our own lives but in the lives of those we touch through our actions and the values we uphold. Our commitment to confidence, resilience, and empowerment extends to the community and society at large. We advocate for change, champion diversity and inclusion, and strive to create a world where everyone can embrace their unique strengths and thrive. Confidence, Resilience, and Empowerment is a gift that keeps giving, and we are dedicated to sharing that gift with the world.

Music Meditation

The Music Meditation Club offers students a serene and supportive environment to relax, recharge, and explore the profound benefits of mindfulness and meditation through music. In today’s fast-paced world, students face immense academic, social, and personal pressures, making it essential to have a space where they can find peace and balance. Our club is a haven for those seeking a mindful outlet to destress, connect, and rediscover their inner calm. At the heart of our activities is the practice of mantra meditation, with a particular focus on the Hare Krishna mantra. This timeless chant has been cherished for centuries as a means to achieve mental clarity, emotional resilience, and spiritual connection. Chanting this mantra is not only a meditative practice but also an uplifting and joyous experience. The rhythmic repetition of sacred sounds helps quiet the mind, allowing participants to immerse themselves in the present moment and develop a deeper sense of self-awareness and harmony. In addition to mantra meditation, the club offers a variety of other mindfulness-based activities designed to support students’ well-being: Guided Meditations: Our guided meditation sessions are carefully designed to help participants release tension, focus their thoughts, and cultivate mindfulness. Led by experienced facilitators, these sessions cater to both beginners and seasoned practitioners, making it easy for anyone to join and benefit from this practice. Sound Baths: Experience the healing power of sound with our immersive sound bath sessions. Using instruments like singing bowls, gongs, and chimes, these sessions create a sonic environment that promotes deep relaxation and rejuvenation. The resonant tones and vibrations wash over participants, helping to dissolve stress, improve focus, and restore balance to the mind and body. Workshops and Discussions: We regularly host workshops and discussions that delve into the philosophy and science of meditation, mindfulness, and sound healing. These events are an excellent opportunity for members to deepen their understanding of meditation practices and explore their impact on mental health and personal growth. Community and Connection: Beyond the meditative practices, the Music Meditation Club is a place to connect with like-minded individuals who share an interest in music, mindfulness, and self-care. Our supportive community encourages open dialogue, shared experiences, and meaningful connections. Our mission is to empower students to take charge of their mental and emotional well-being by integrating music and meditation into their daily lives. Whether you’re looking to reduce stress, improve focus, or simply explore a new hobby, the Music Meditation Club welcomes you with open arms.

TRUST @ UCLA

TRUST is a student-led organization at UCLA where undergraduate volunteers lead interactive workshops that help youth build better habits and take control of their time, attention, and well-being. We partner with schools, after-school programs, and youth-based nonprofits to host workshops throughout the school year on topics like stress management, time management, self-esteem, and exercise habits. Beyond leading workshops, members can join committees focused on curriculum design, research, and outreach to develop evidence-based workshop plans and expand our partnerships. At its core, TRUST believes that small habits build upon each other to create our lives, and we want to empower youth to take control of their habits before their habits take control of them, so they can build the lives they envision.
