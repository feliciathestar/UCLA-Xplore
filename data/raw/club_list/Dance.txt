Our team fosters a family environment that emphasizes dedication, growth, and teamwork. Established in 1993, ACA All Day (previously known as ACA Hip-Hop) has gained recognition within the Southern California dance scene over the years. As an Open Style dance team, our members train in a variety of styles, including Hip-Hop, Isolations, Waacking/Whacking, House, Popping, Contemporary, and more. We have competed at competitions like Vibe, Ultimate Brawl, Prelude, and Bridge/Resurgence with original sets choreographed by our current team and alumni. The skills dancers acquire and the strong friendships they build have helped ACA evolve into a supportive network of both current members and alumni that extends beyond just dance. With foundations rooted in professionalism and love for one another, ACA aims to inspire and be inspired while continuing to strengthen our presence in the dance community.

Expressive Movement Initiative (EMI)

The Expressive Movement Initiative (EMI) is an organization that aims to introduce children with developmental disabilities to the art of creative movement through weekly dance classes. The first division of EMI is a successful program at the University of Oklahoma that has enabled the children of the program to significantly improve across a spectrum of social, emotional, and physical domains. To bring this organization to UCLA, we will utilize the assistance of the founder, who is now an LA resident, as well as a team of undergraduate volunteers who will foster a personal, one-on-one teaching and mentoring relationship with each of the children. At the end of the academic year, we will hold an annual performance to showcase the growth of the students for their family and friends.

Foundations Choreography

Foundations Choreography was founded in 2014 to address a gap observed by our founders in UCLA’s dance community. The dance community was primarily dominated by competitive teams, and there wasn’t a space for beginner and intermediate dancers. Initially, the organization focused on hosting workshops and teaching fundamental hip-hop choreography to interested students. Then, the organization expanded to include beginner/intermediate training teams, allowing anyone interested in dance to grow, train, and challenge themselves in a safe space. This soon led to the introduction of Wintensive, an annual event where professional choreographers come to teach the UCLA community for free, fostering greater cultural and dance awareness. Now, the organization has quarterly training teams and celebrates their achievements during our quarterly showcases. We also host workshops every quarter to continue to inspire and educate more dancers with various cultural dances and techniques.

The Swing Club at UCLA

The Swing Club at UCLA is a student organization dedicated to promoting a positive social experience on the UCLA campus through the art of swing dancing. Its mission is to introduce East Coast, Lindy Hop, and West Coast swing dancing to members of the UCLA community, provide a place for members to practice, and connect members to the swing club community in the greater Los Angeles area. Club management operates strictly on a volunteer basis. Since the club’s founding in 2008, membership has been open to all UCLA students and affiliates. There are currently around 10 members. Meetings are two hours once per week, consisting of beginner and intermediate dance lessons as well as social dancing. The group is fortunate to have two talented and experienced volunteer dance instructors that teach lessons at every meeting. Outside of meetings, the club organizes on-campus events open to all students, and trips to off-campus venues like “Lindy Groove” and “Third Saturday Swing” in Pasadena.
