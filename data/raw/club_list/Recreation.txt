Backgammon Club at UCLA

The Backgammon Club is going to be dedicated to forming a campus community of players who share a passion for this ancient and intellectually stimulating game. Whether an experienced player or completely new to backgammon, this club will offer an inclusive environment for learning and mastering the rules, strategies, and subtleties of the game. Backgammon, a game with over 5,000 years of history, not only serves as an amazing tradition into various cultures but also as a mental challenge that sharpens critical thinking, strategic planning, and decision-making. Its unique blend of skill and chance makes it an excellent tool for developing problem-solving skills under pressure, improve cognitive abilities, enhance pattern recognition, and boost resilience. The club will serve as a platform to connect with fellow students across campus who share an interest in the game, making it easier to find playing partners and form friendships. For people new to the game, there will be tutorials online and in-person when requested. We will hold regular game nights, workshops, and strategy sessions designed to help both beginners and advanced players improve their skills. Additionally, the club will organize friendly competitions and tournaments, offering members the opportunity to engage in healthy rivalry while also improving and enjoying this historic cultural tradition. The club will have backgammon players with years of experience, who are going to be ready to help other club members while enjoying the game themselves.

Bruin Geolological Society

This is meant to be the ucla geology club. We want to enrich students' understanding and appreciation of rocks and earth processes outside of the classroom. In doing so, we hope to get more students involved in the Earth, Planetary, and Space Sciences, EPSS, here at UCLA. As such, the club is open to any current ucla graduate or undergraduate students. Additionally, we would like to take field trips, ideally once per quarter, that go off campus. This would allow our members to experience and learn about the diverse and dynamic geology of southern California. We are blessed with an environment that is very conducive to learning as we have vastly different types of rocks readily accessible within a few hours of UCLA.

The Potato Game

The Potato Game will be a campus-wide game that aims to foster new friendships while brightening up the school day. The game rules will be as follows: Several people will be assigned a "hot potato," and the game will last a certain period of time. The goal of the game is to get rid of the hot potato by the end of the time period by meeting other players in person and passing the "hot potato" on. It will be tracked via an app that we will develop, and there are several rounds. We believe that these encounters will provide a great opportunity for players to introduce themselves and bond over an active, healthy game! There will be more opportunities to connect during general meetings.

“brvino” Undergraduate Wine Club

“brvino” Undergraduate Wine Club is created to deliver wine education to UCLA undergraduates and bring together interested students. We want to educate our members on the infinite diversity of the wine world including its most notable regions, production methods, history, and culture of wine around the world. For the students interested in careers in the wine world, we would like to create a community of like-minded individuals to facilitate discussion of the wine industry and seek opportunities together. Lastly, “brvino” Undergraduate Wine Club wants to have a positive impact on the drinking culture at the university, promote thoughtful, moderate, and epicurean approach to wine consumption, and discourage excessive and harmful drinking.
