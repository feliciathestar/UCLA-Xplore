Bruin Caregiving Scholars

Bruin Caregiving Scholars (BCS) champions the diverse community of UCLA students who navigate academic commitments alongside caregiving roles for minors, dependent adults, the elderly, and especially those caring for individuals with mental or physical disabilities, including neurodivergent dependents. Emphasizing inclusivity, BCS extends a warm welcome to all who identify as caregivers, including parenting students and anyone who wishes to learn more about the community. We aim to provide community, tailored resources, programming, and advocacy to cultivate a nurturing and empowering environment and advocate for meaningful changes across the UCLA and broader UC system.
