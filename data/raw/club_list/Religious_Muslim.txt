ALIF

The mission of ALIF is to support Muslim students studying engineering, computer science, and related fields at UCLA in achieving technical excellence, professional development, and spiritual growth. Through workshops, networking opportunities, and professional development initiatives, we aim to equip Muslim students with the skills necessary to excel in their careers while maintaining their faith. We also dedicate ourselves to serving the broader Muslim community by offering technical support to masjids and nonprofits, creating impactful projects that address community challenges, and promoting collaboration among members. In this shared endeavor, we seek to build a space where faith and technology harmoniously coexist, ensuring that our efforts benefit not only the present generation but also pave the way for future Muslim leaders in tech.

Faces of Afrikan Muslims

Faces of Afrikan Muslims is a student organization dedicated to creating a safe and inclusive space for Black Muslims. It promotes discussions highlighting the contributions of Black people to Islam and its rich, expansive history, while also building a strong sense of community. We also want to make sure we extend the space to non-muslims and non-Black people alike to ensure that they are receiving positive engagement with our community. As Black Muslims, we are committed to providing an outlet to address the racism and marginalization that permeates all aspects of campus life. We are dedicated to fostering a safe space for the growth of our vibrant community, while empowering young Black Muslims to shape their identities and build stronger alliances with mutual allies. Expect socials, famsgiving, heartwork night, collabs and other events this quarter/year!!
