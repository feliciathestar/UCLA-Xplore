Bridge at UCLA

Bridge at UCLA is a workshop and mentorship based program that aims to bridge educational gaps for underprivileged high school students. Through our research on current educational support efforts, we discovered a generational gap between established programs and the high school students they serve. Although these efforts are still impactful, the support is not as relevant to the current day academic and career atmosphere, and the connection between mentors and mentees is less meaningful. This inspired us to create a university based program that runs off current students that have relevant experience in these areas. Bridge at UCLA aims to increase graduation rates through a mentorship program between collegiate students (at UCLA) and low-income students between the 10-12 grade range in local public schools. Our intent strays from increasing application turnout; instead, focusing on building strong professional skills to demonstrate career paths stemming from a high school diploma. As undergraduates with firsthand experience within higher education and the job market, our initiative is unique and relevant to high schools. On campus, we will recruit students through club fairs and departmental advertisements. We will search for students who are motivated to help youth, and train them to lead workshops and become one-on-one mentors. The workshops will be focused on a 5 stage curriculum of skill building, as outlined in the presented Journey Map, including: resumes, interviewing, college advising, scholarship opportunities, and academic tutoring. However, a major aspect of this program will be its emphasis on existing opportunities that are available to students looking to join the workforce, utilizing skillful development from our program. The mentorship program fosters meaningful connections between volunteers and students to provide personalized support for creating a future pathway, with emphasis on empowerment and student-led connection during the program. Thus, rather than serving several students at once per mentor, we will cater the experience to be more individualized and direct. We will approach this initiative by partnering with schools in LAUSD, specifically those in low-income regions. This will personalize our approach to the schools because we will better understand what the students need, learning from both staff and students.

You do not have to be an engineer or science major: all majors are welcome.

Companion Care

Companion Care (CC)'s mission is to build sustainable bridges between people experiencing homelessness and healthcare services in Los Angeles. To achieve this end, CC partners with the Mobile Clinic Project at UCLA (MCP) to offer clients accompanied and/or unaccompanied primary care appointments to Wesley Health Center. CC’s client base is composed of individuals who are ready to seek primary care services, but who face structural and interpersonal barriers to care such as medical mistrust, language barriers, and chronic conditions that cannot be addressed in an acute healthcare setting. Through the practice of accompaniment, a practice that prioritizes the client’s voice and lived-experience in their healthcare journey, companions serve as partners for clients re-entering the traditional healthcare setting. When a client chooses an accompanied appointment, they attend with a companion whose role is to facilitate a sense of felt safety, comfort, and agency for the client. Practically, accompaniment entails filling out paperwork, communicating long-term goals, and arranging transportation, in addition to tackling any other barriers between clients and the services that they deserve. CC’s ultimate goal is to make healthcare an equitable resource through solidarity, humility, and partnership.

Good Clothes Good People

Good Clothes Good People is a volunteer-based organization that has been serving students since November of 2018. We aim to increase accessibility to basic needs items for all UCLA undergraduate students. Our volunteers operate a basic needs distribution center in TBA, open 10am-5pm, where students can donate/pick up clothing for no additional cost. Here, students can also pick up a variety of everyday items, including soap, toothpaste, menstrual products, pencils, notebooks, folders, and more. We provide free rentals of important resources, and currently offer umbrellas for 3 days at a time, formal clothing for a week at a time, and wheelchairs/crutches for 3 weeks at a time. One of our main goals is to be as sustainable as possible, and this is reflected not only in our practices, but also in the recycled and organic products we offer, as well as the hygiene refill station where students can refill their bottles with products such as body wash, laundry detergent, and lotion. Our center is also essentially a free thrift shop, reducing textile waste by hundreds of pounds annually. We receive the majority of our funding from the $0.34/quarter GCGP Basic Needs Referendum, passed in 2020, and we use this money to support the UCLA community. We hope you'll stop by to pick up/donate! If you're interested in volunteering with us, please let us know via email or Instagram!

Their mission was to build a diverse and inclusive community of students with a passion for philanthropy and a keen interest in healthcare careers. Recognizing the lack of volunteering opportunities and the diminishing sense of community among students due to the pandemic, they swiftly acted to bridge this gap, fostering meaningful engagements between aspiring healthcare professionals and their local communities for mutual growth. Our HLS chapter at UCLA will have an emphasis on healthcare and community service, and is designed to serve underprivileged communities while also prioritizing the professional growth of their members.

Our goal is to establish opportunities for UCLA students to reach out to the underserved communities in Los Angeles and abroad by providing clinical and social services; where people of all backgrounds who are unable to afford medical services can have access to high-quality medical care without revealing private information. We strive to provide “Services for the Community, By the Community” in order to empower the communities we serve. We do this by recruiting members from within the communities we serve, working with organizations in the area, and asking people from within the community about their most pressing needs via surveys and interviews. We operate as a group of student volunteers and are not a business or non-profit organization.

Maternal and Pediatric Community Outreach Nursing Organization at UCLA

The Maternal and Pediatric Community Outreach Nursing Organization at UCLA “MAP” is a community of UCLA nursing students eager to improve the health and well being of the mothers and children among at-risk and underserved groups across Los Angeles. Our goals lie in direct engagement with the community through various initiatives such as volunteering, organizing donation drives, and partnering with local organizations aligned with our mission statement. Through awareness, advocacy, and outreach, we aim to make a positive and meaningful impact on the mothers and children of Los Angeles, with a particular focus on underserved communities. Our mission is to develop a community of future nurses passionate about advancing the quality of life for vulnerable mothers and children. By addressing both maternal and pediatric populations as one, we focus on the compassionate care of families as a whole. This holistic approach to community engagement vicariously empowers UCLA nursing students to embrace patient-centered nursing practice that considers the needs of the entire family and addresses the unique challenges faced by these groups. While there are a few nursing clubs at UCLA that target interests in either pediatric or women’s health nursing independently, the Maternal and Pediatric Community Outreach Nursing Organization distinguishes itself by embracing an action-oriented, community-based approach that recognizes the deep interconnectedness of mothers, children, and families within health and wellness. Our commitment extends beyond UCLA’s campus as we directly engage with the surrounding Los Angeles metropolitan area, with a focus on vulnerable populations. We strive for our members to be agents of engagement and change among at-risk or underserved groups, and to engage in the advocacy and community involvement they will carry into their future nursing care.

Semillas aims to provide the children of farmworkers with the tools and resources necessary to further their education at an institution of higher learning whether it be a community college or a four-year university. We will do this by leading mentoring sites and university tours for children of farmworkers. In addition, with the understanding that the children of farmworkers face several obstacles which hinder their ability to succeed academically, we seek to offer tutoring services within our site meetings to help students maintain or improve their GPA.

The Westwood Food Cooperative

The WWFC is a mission-driven club whose goal is to create a more just and sustainable food system. We envision a world where farmers & growers are compensated fairly for their labor; where soil and land are treated as the invaluable resources that they are; and where all people have access to culturally appropriate, locally grown, highly nutritious food for an affordable price. We’re challenging the unequal distribution of food access in our market, driven by the United States’ subsidization of commodity crops that prioritizes quantity and revenue over public health. Our CSA program provides a radical alternative to this system by supplying locally grown food to our student body that is affordable & accessible. Additionally, our programs aim to reconnect consumers with the land and people who grew the food they eat, as we believe that our most intimate connection to our planet is the food it grows for us. We are also committed to partnering with other campus clubs to provide fresh produce to food-insecure students. Lastly, we write and publish articles that spread awareness about sustainable and ethical farming.

The sorority was founded on the simple belief that sorority elitism and socializing should not overshadow the real mission for progressive organizations - to address societal mores, ills, prejudices, poverty, and health concerns of the day. We were founded on four principles that our members still demonstrate today: Scholarship, Service, Sisterhood, and Finer Womanhood. On January 23, 1982, seven collegiate women at the University of California, Los Angeles chartered the Nu Lambda Chapter of Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc. Ever since, the ladies of Zeta have exemplified the principles of Zeta through campus programs, community service, and in their own personal endeavors.
