Chosen Campus Ministry

We are a non-denominational christian club focused on helping students grow in their spiritual life and learning what it looks like to follow Jesus through the bible. Each quarter many students come and study the bible with us and gain an experience like no other. They find spiritual revival, enlightenment and find the purpose of their existence. We believe that the bible calls us to be excellent in all areas of life and that includes our education. We encourage students to be disciplined in their studies and keep an excellent work ethic as they study the bible and attend their classes. These bible studies have changed the lives of so many individuals. We've had people come addicted to drugs, plagued with anxiety and stress, hurt emotionally, with no hope and the list goes on and on. We help them see that God has a plan for their life and show them what a life with God could look like. So many have seen true happiness and hope for the very first time and their lives are forever changed. Outside of personal bible studies we offer club meetings throughout the week as well as a Sunday service with the home church we are apart of. This gives students a valuable sense of belonging within a community full of sold out believers focused on taking care of each other and display the love of Christ. We do not discriminate anyone but welcome all who want to study the bible and get to know Jesus. We invite all types of people from all different types backgrounds and upbringings to check out what were all about!

Coptic Orthodox Christian Club

The Coptic Church is about 2,000 years old - it is enriched with knowledge and tradition taken all the way from St. Mark, an apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ. St. Mark ended up being a martyr for our church, as so have been most of our preachers and believers, but he did spread the faith to us and we are here to learn more about it as well as spread that knowledge to all others! The purpose of our club is to reach out to all students, no matter what religion or ethnicity at UCLA. We exist so that we may provide a means by which the Orthodox community can grow spiritually. Our goal is to make sure that we all grow stronger in knowledge, faith, unity, and love. We do so by providing fun activities, spiritual meetings, prayer meetings, Bible studies, community service, etc. It is not just limited to Copts, but to everyone who is seeking God and would like to find Him; we welcome questions and curiosity! Please ask and contact us if you would like to learn more!

Destino de UCLA

Latinos are the future of the United States! We’re a fast-growing and young community. Right now 1 out of every 5 kids born in this country is Latino. And more Latino/a students are enrolling in college than at any other time in history! For us, it’s about more than numbers. We believe that God has a special destiny for Latinos. He is going to use Latinos to change this nation and change the world. And so we exist to help raise up a generation of leaders from the Latino and Hispanic communities to change the world!

We also co-program with many other South Asian Organizations on campus in order to provide students with other outlets, professional and cultural. In spirituality we have Kirtan nights, set prayer times, meditation, Gurbani and Punjabi classes, and debates on the faith. Additionally, our association provides the students of UCLA with the opportunity to engage in unique community service efforts such as Sikh Relief (who provide assistance by fighting the drug problem in Punjab, help Sikh Political Prisoners, provide relief in Nepal or anywhere else there is a natural disaster) as well as work with the United Sikh Movement to offer langar (free food) to individuals that lack these resources (i.e. Skid Row, Riverside, and other regions in LA). Lastly, we make sure our members feel at home and enjoy the beautiful city of LA by hosting mixers, bonfires, beach trips, hikes, movie nights, ice skating and a range of other fun social activities. From day one, we hope to be efficient with our professional lives but at the same time enjoy our college years through Seva, Simran (prayer and mediation), and Kirt (working diligently). We are partnered with the United Sikh Movement, the official link between SSAs across California, to constantly expand and connect with the Sikh sangat at large.
