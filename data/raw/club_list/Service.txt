Addiction Awareness Association (AAA)

Introduction: The Addiction Awareness Association (AAA) is a dynamic and dedicated college club committed to addressing one of the most pressing public health issues of our time – addiction. Founded on the principles of compassion, education, and community involvement, AAA has been making a profound impact on and off campus by raising awareness, preventing addiction, and connecting vulnerable communities with crucial rehabilitation resources. In this comprehensive description, we will delve into the mission, activities, and impact of AAA, highlighting its invaluable role in fostering a society that is better informed, more compassionate, and equipped to battle addiction. Mission and Vision: The core mission of the Addiction Awareness Association is to bridge the gap between local needs and rehabilitation resources to combat addiction effectively. AAA envisions a society where addiction is met with understanding, support, and accessible resources, rather than stigma and isolation. This vision is founded on the belief that addiction is a treatable illness, and those affected by it deserve a chance at recovery, regardless of their background. Key Objectives: 1. Awareness: AAA seeks to dispel myths and misconceptions surrounding addiction. Through workshops, seminars, and awareness campaigns, the club strives to educate the college community and the wider public about the root causes, consequences, and signs of addiction. 2. Prevention: AAA takes a proactive approach by working to prevent addiction before it takes hold. Club members engage in outreach programs to educate local schools, colleges, and communities about the dangers of substance abuse, providing information on risk factors and healthy coping strategies. 3. Rehabilitation: The heart of AAA's mission is to connect vulnerable communities with rehabilitation resources. Club members actively research and collaborate with local rehab centers, support groups, and counselors to ensure that those in need can access treatment and support. Approach: AAA operates on a needs-based approach, recognizing that addiction impacts different communities in various ways. The club seeks to understand the specific challenges faced by local communities and tailors its initiatives accordingly. This empathetic approach allows AAA to make a meaningful impact and build trust within the communities it serves. Activities and Initiatives: 1. Community Surveys: AAA conducts regular surveys and interviews within the local community to gauge the extent of addiction-related issues. These surveys are vital in identifying gaps in knowledge and resources. 2. Resource Coordination: Once needs are identified, AAA collaborates with local rehab centers, support groups, and healthcare providers to connect individuals struggling with addiction to appropriate resources. This includes organizing transportation, financial assistance, and counseling services. 3. Awareness Campaigns: AAA organizes a variety of awareness campaigns, from informational flyers and online webinars to panel discussions and guest speakers. These events aim to educate both the college campus and the wider community about addiction and its impact. 4. School Outreach: Members of AAA visit local schools to engage with students on the dangers of substance abuse, providing them with age-appropriate information and resources to make informed decisions. 5. Peer Support: The club runs support groups for individuals in recovery, providing a safe and non-judgmental space for sharing experiences and offering peer support. Impact: The Addiction Awareness Association's impact extends beyond the college campus. By focusing on local needs and collaborating with existing resources, AAA has played a pivotal role in improving the lives of individuals and communities affected by addiction. Some of the key impacts include: 1. Increased Awareness: AAA has reached thousands of individuals through its awareness campaigns, contributing to a better-informed society that is more empathetic towards those struggling with addiction. 2. Prevention: By educating local schools and colleges, AAA has helped prevent substance abuse among young adults, empowering them to make healthier choices. 3. Rehabilitation Support: Through its resource coordination efforts, AAA has facilitated hundreds of individuals' access to treatment, counseling, and support services. 4. Community Engagement: The club has fostered a sense of community among those affected by addiction, reducing isolation and stigma and promoting a supportive environment for recovery. Conclusion: The Addiction Awareness Association embodies the spirit of volunteerism, compassion, and community engagement. By addressing addiction at its core and working tirelessly to bridge the gap between local needs and rehabilitation resources, AAA has become a beacon of hope for individuals and communities grappling with the scourge of addiction.

American Cancer Society On Campus

American Cancer Society On Campus (ACS) is a collegiate branch of the American Cancer Society that brings the fight against cancer directly to college students by planning Relay for Life at UCLA, encouraging education, inspiring advocacy, and celebrating survivorship. Mainly, we aim to build a community for those affected by cancer and work so that one day, no one has to hear the dreaded words "you have cancer." Relay for Life is a 24-hour fundraising festival held at Drake Stadium to celebrate survivors, remember those we've lost, and fight back against a disease that affects and connects us all in some way! The event includes inspiring ceremonies, our Relay Runway Pageant, talented performers, a silent rave, and so much more. In the past five years, we raised over $1,000,000 for the American Cancer Society to fund cancer research and patient services to support those battling, making us the largest college Relay West of the Mississippi! Throughout the year, in addition to planning Relay, we also plan education rallies on Bruin Walk for various types of cancers, organize hospital visits to bring cards to patients on the Oncology floor, and host fundraising events such as comedy shows and concerts! Since our start 20 years ago, American Cancer Society On Campus has been recognized with the Leaders of Hope award three years in a row, Survivor & Caregiver Engagement Chapter of the Year three years in a row, Advocacy Chapter of the Year, and Top Fundraiser of the year.

Autism Advocacy at UCLA

Autism Advocacy at UCLA was founded in hopes of providing resources for students to connect and come together to help spread knowledge about autism, educate our peers, and serve those on our campus and in our community. Through fundraising events, volunteering, and various advocacy projects and efforts, we educate students and faculty members on how they are able to make a difference and empower the Autism community in the Los Angeles area. Our goal is to foster an environment of understanding of those on the spectrum and to emphasize learning about Autism from those on the spectrum’s experiences rather than merely “raising awareness” of Autism.

Blood Donation Initiative at DGSOM

Mission: With a team of medical students, we seek to organize and publicize blood drives at DGSOM and create a long-lasting partnership between the DGSOM students and the UCLA blood donation center. About us: The DGSOM Blood Donation Initiative was created to establish multi-annual blood drives at DGSOM in collaboration with interprofessional colleagues across the dental, nursing, and undergraduate UCLA campuses, provide medical students with shadowing and research opportunities within laboratory medicine, provide students with exposure and experience in pathology medicine, and provide opportunities for teaching pre-medical students about blood transfusion medicine. The DGSOM Blood Donation Initiative (DGSOM BDI) is dedicated to increasing blood donations in support of our local healthcare system. Through annual blood drives, medical students will have the opportunity to collaborate and work in conjunction with the UCLA Blood and Platelet Center. Furthermore, DGSOM BDI aims to provide medical students with opportunities to learn about laboratory medicine, research, and the end-to-end blood donation process via interactions with faculty and residents at UCLA.

Bridge at UCLA

Bridge at UCLA is a workshop and mentorship based program that aims to bridge educational gaps for underprivileged high school students. Through our research on current educational support efforts, we discovered a generational gap between established programs and the high school students they serve. Although these efforts are still impactful, the support is not as relevant to the current day academic and career atmosphere, and the connection between mentors and mentees is less meaningful. This inspired us to create a university based program that runs off current students that have relevant experience in these areas. Bridge at UCLA aims to increase graduation rates through a mentorship program between collegiate students (at UCLA) and low-income students between the 10-12 grade range in local public schools. Our intent strays from increasing application turnout; instead, focusing on building strong professional skills to demonstrate career paths stemming from a high school diploma. As undergraduates with firsthand experience within higher education and the job market, our initiative is unique and relevant to high schools. On campus, we will recruit students through club fairs and departmental advertisements. We will search for students who are motivated to help youth, and train them to lead workshops and become one-on-one mentors. The workshops will be focused on a 5 stage curriculum of skill building, as outlined in the presented Journey Map, including: resumes, interviewing, college advising, scholarship opportunities, and academic tutoring. However, a major aspect of this program will be its emphasis on existing opportunities that are available to students looking to join the workforce, utilizing skillful development from our program. The mentorship program fosters meaningful connections between volunteers and students to provide personalized support for creating a future pathway, with emphasis on empowerment and student-led connection during the program. Thus, rather than serving several students at once per mentor, we will cater the experience to be more individualized and direct. We will approach this initiative by partnering with schools in LAUSD, specifically those in low-income regions. This will personalize our approach to the schools because we will better understand what the students need, learning from both staff and students.

Community College Field Biology Alliance

The Community College Field Biology Alliance will provide community college students from underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) the opportunity to experience scientific field work prior to transferring to a four-year university. Students will be mentored by graduate students from UCLA’s Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology through all stages of an independent scientific project; from development of methods, to data collection on the UC James San Jacinto Mountains Reserve one of the 39 field sites apart of the University of California Natural Reserve System, to the write up of a scientific poster. Further, it is our goal to foster meaningful relationships between the student interns and the graduate student mentors that will last beyond just completion of their project. This will be accomplished through weekly and monthly meetings and community oriented social events. Lastly, during the duration of the program students will also be exposed to workshops and information sessions aimed at assisting in the transferring process and building tangible knowledge of scientific methods that can be applied in their future undergraduate research and graduate studies. Our program structure is as follows: (1) Community College students interested in the natural sciences and conducting scientific research in the field will be invited to apply to this program. The program will run from April to August, culminating in a 10 day trip to the field to collect data and the completion of a poster in time for the UCLA Summer Poster Symposium. (2) Students will be paired with UCLA graduate students in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department whose field research interests most closely align with their own. Students will meet virtually with their mentors weekly and in person monthly. Students and their mentors will develop an independent observational field project that could feasibly be completed with ten days of data collection during the summer. (3)By the beginning of July, students will have completed a literature review and a methods protocol for their proposed field project. In late July, students and graduate mentors will travel to the James San Jacinto Mountains Reserve. This reserve is located approximately 2 hours from UCLA in the San Bernardino National Forest and is a part of the University of California Natural Reserve System. Travel, food, and lodging will be included for all participants. (4) While in the field participants will be assisted by their graduate student mentors in collecting and analyzing data for their proposed project. Before returning home each student will have a completed scientific poster. (5) Aside from enacting their proposed research, students will attend skill-building workshops focused on cultivating tangible scientific and fieldwork skills that can be used throughout their careers. For example, interns will be introduced to ‘R’ Statistical software for data analysis and taught how to use species identification guides in the field.

Companion Care

Companion Care (CC)'s mission is to build sustainable bridges between people experiencing homelessness and healthcare services in Los Angeles. To achieve this end, CC partners with the Mobile Clinic Project at UCLA (MCP) to offer clients accompanied and/or unaccompanied primary care appointments to Wesley Health Center. CC’s client base is composed of individuals who are ready to seek primary care services, but who face structural and interpersonal barriers to care such as medical mistrust, language barriers, and chronic conditions that cannot be addressed in an acute healthcare setting. Through the practice of accompaniment, a practice that prioritizes the client’s voice and lived-experience in their healthcare journey, companions serve as partners for clients re-entering the traditional healthcare setting. When a client chooses an accompanied appointment, they attend with a companion whose role is to facilitate a sense of felt safety, comfort, and agency for the client. Practically, accompaniment entails filling out paperwork, communicating long-term goals, and arranging transportation, in addition to tackling any other barriers between clients and the services that they deserve. CC’s ultimate goal is to make healthcare an equitable resource through solidarity, humility, and partnership.

Doula Project at UCLA

The UCLA Doula Project aims to support and train medical students to provide informational, physical, and emotional doula support to clients seeking pregnancy termination in the West Los Angeles area. In doing so, the program aims to supplement clinical training in reproductive health among medical trainees and provide hands-on, client-centered volunteer experiences at a partner family planning clinic. The Doula Project, now in its second year of operation at West Medical OBGYN (UCLA Family Planning Clinic), is a student-led organization that offers an annual abortion and loss doula training to DGSOM students that is facilitated by OBGYN faculty at UCLA and a community-based doula organization. The program operates year-round; trained student doulas take on volunteer shifts to offer in-person and virtual doula support to all patients at West Medical who opt into the program. Last year, volunteer medical student doulas provided support to over 80 patients seeking termination of pregnancy.

EmpowHER

EmpowHER is committed to partnering with shelters for unhoused populations like the Los Angeles House of Ruth, orphanages in Tijuana such as Casa Hogar La Gloria, and non-profit organizations to uplift disadvantaged female-identifying individuals and children. EmpowHER seeks to raise awareness about and decrease the challenges disproportionately faced by unhoused and underserved female-identifying individuals, focusing on multilingual feminine hygiene and overall women's health education, dermatological health issues, and maternal psychiatric conditions. Additionally, we plan to extend our reach across borders by partnering with orphanages in Tijuana to improve health literacy, cultivate fulfilling mentorships, and support children’s health through donation drives and community outreach. To address disparities in basic needs access, EmpowHER will host drives to gather hygiene products, food, and clothing. Our next step would be to host workshops and assemble care packages/health kits to distribute to unhoused and underserved communities. We also plan to collaborate with local community partners and healthcare providers to offer free preventative health screenings and medical consultations in areas facing disparities in healthcare access. EmpowHER plans to engage medical students and faculty in every step of our volunteer efforts to advance health equity for all underserved female-identifying and child patient populations. We believe that housing inequities can have a profound impact on female-identifying individuals and children in underserved communities, and ensuring access to safe, affordable housing is essential to fostering stability, dignity, and opportunities for ensuring health equity.

Good Clothes Good People

Good Clothes Good People is a volunteer-based organization that has been serving students since November of 2018. We aim to increase accessibility to basic needs items for all UCLA undergraduate students. Our volunteers operate a basic needs distribution center in TBA, open 10am-5pm, where students can donate/pick up clothing for no additional cost. Here, students can also pick up a variety of everyday items, including soap, toothpaste, menstrual products, pencils, notebooks, folders, and more. We provide free rentals of important resources, and currently offer umbrellas for 3 days at a time, formal clothing for a week at a time, and wheelchairs/crutches for 3 weeks at a time. One of our main goals is to be as sustainable as possible, and this is reflected not only in our practices, but also in the recycled and organic products we offer, as well as the hygiene refill station where students can refill their bottles with products such as body wash, laundry detergent, and lotion. Our center is also essentially a free thrift shop, reducing textile waste by hundreds of pounds annually. We receive the majority of our funding from the $0.34/quarter GCGP Basic Needs Referendum, passed in 2020, and we use this money to support the UCLA community. We hope you'll stop by to pick up/donate! If you're interested in volunteering with us, please let us know via email or Instagram!

Their mission was to build a diverse and inclusive community of students with a passion for philanthropy and a keen interest in healthcare careers. Recognizing the lack of volunteering opportunities and the diminishing sense of community among students due to the pandemic, they swiftly acted to bridge this gap, fostering meaningful engagements between aspiring healthcare professionals and their local communities for mutual growth. Our HLS chapter at UCLA will have an emphasis on healthcare and community service, and is designed to serve underprivileged communities while also prioritizing the professional growth of their members.

Holistic Care

Our organization aims to provide non-medical forms of therapy and relief for patients in hospital and clinic settings, ranging from pediatric to geriatric. These patients are in postoperative or clinic-based recovery for a variety of chronic and debilitating conditions, suffering from isolation and accompanying fears, anxieties and pains. Holistic Care lessens these symptoms through certified patient visits where volunteers employ tactile, auditory and visual therapies to enhance and augment postoperative care. With the help of our research committee, we are constantly learning and implementing psychologically tested techniques, therapies and methods of treatment during these visits. These non-medical forms of relief, both physical and mental, have been proven to transform the lives of patients in need of personalized and thoughtful care. Our volunteers understand the individual needs of each patient and their condition, showing that we care about the wellbeing of every person we serve and we are dedicated to restoring their hope, happiness and health through our innovative applications.

Magical Moments Foundation at UCLA

Magical Moments Foundation is a wish-granting organization for children with craniofacial disorders. We work to make a difference in these children’s lives, spread awareness of the lifelong harm caused by appearance-related stigma, and promote acceptance of facial diversity. Children with facial differences often endure the pain of teasing, bullying, and isolation— pain that can leave emotional scars that last a lifetime. Children that face the world with a difference also endure the challenge of a more silent, but just as damaging, form of stigma: that of unconscious bias. And so, many children with differences grow up in a world that tells them that their dreams must be smaller than those of their peers. Magical Moments is working to change all of that. We create magical experiences that restore hope and provide comfort, inspiration, and encouragement to children with facial differences that are the result of genetic disorders, congenital anomalies, cancer treatment, severe trauma and burns. We help children understand that they are not at all limited by their appearance, but only by the size of their dreams! Through the magical moments that we create, we not only make a difference in children’s lives, but we also promote awareness of the lifelong harm caused by appearance-related stigma and create more widespread acceptance of facial diversity within our communities. As an organization, we grant wishes that teach children with facial differences to believe in themselves while teaching the world to see and celebrate the beauty in every child!

Maternal and Pediatric Community Outreach Nursing Organization at UCLA

The Maternal and Pediatric Community Outreach Nursing Organization at UCLA “MAP” is a community of UCLA nursing students eager to improve the health and well being of the mothers and children among at-risk and underserved groups across Los Angeles. Our goals lie in direct engagement with the community through various initiatives such as volunteering, organizing donation drives, and partnering with local organizations aligned with our mission statement. Through awareness, advocacy, and outreach, we aim to make a positive and meaningful impact on the mothers and children of Los Angeles, with a particular focus on underserved communities. Our mission is to develop a community of future nurses passionate about advancing the quality of life for vulnerable mothers and children. By addressing both maternal and pediatric populations as one, we focus on the compassionate care of families as a whole. This holistic approach to community engagement vicariously empowers UCLA nursing students to embrace patient-centered nursing practice that considers the needs of the entire family and addresses the unique challenges faced by these groups. While there are a few nursing clubs at UCLA that target interests in either pediatric or women’s health nursing independently, the Maternal and Pediatric Community Outreach Nursing Organization distinguishes itself by embracing an action-oriented, community-based approach that recognizes the deep interconnectedness of mothers, children, and families within health and wellness. Our commitment extends beyond UCLA’s campus as we directly engage with the surrounding Los Angeles metropolitan area, with a focus on vulnerable populations. We strive for our members to be agents of engagement and change among at-risk or underserved groups, and to engage in the advocacy and community involvement they will carry into their future nursing care.

Medical Aid Initiative (MAI)

The Medical Aid Initiative is a student-founded organization that provides resources to organizations that share the same vision of providing free medical care and health education to both domestic and international communities. Through our partnership with UCLA Health, MAI collects excess medical supplies for use in global health missions. Since U.S. hospitals produce over two million tons of medical waste each year, MAI helps to reallocate usable medical supplies to where they are needed. MAI's mission is to increase sustainability in healthcare, distribute medical supplies to global communities, and increase awareness around the issue of medical waste. Over the last five years, MAI has been able to divert nearly 8,000 pounds of waste from landfills and donated over $450,000 worth of supplies to medical aid organizations around the world.

Neurodiversity Health Chats at UCLA

Neurodiversity Health Chats (NDHC) is originally a student led project (now club) led by Dr. Emily Hotez, Ph.D. and the UC-LEND clinic-- and funded by the Association of University Centers on Disabilities (AUCD)-- that seeks to improve the health and well-being of neurodivergent individuals through outreach and education. Since 2021, NDHC has improved access to resources and credible information for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD). NDHC is directly responsive to the well-established findings that neurodivergent populations have experienced disproportionate negative mental and physical health outcomes from the COVID-19 pandemic. NDHC applies a multi-pronged strategy to support neurodivergent populations. First, NDHC leverages social media to translate and disseminate valuable information on vaccination guidelines, needle anxieties, and barriers to vaccination. NDHC is highly adept at creating and disseminating plain language and accessible social media infographics through a range of channels, as well as conducting and sharing in-depth interviews with public health experts and individuals with lived experience. In addition to these outreach efforts, NDHC leads a portfolio of research. Last year, NDHC conducted a qualitative research study that analyzed key themes from interviews with medical and non-medical health professionals, communicators, and individuals with I/DD and their caregivers. Qualitative findings revealed that misinformation, vaccine risk perception, sensory sensitivities, and structural hardship were the most significant barriers to COVID-19 vaccination. In order to be responsive to the findings from our research study, NDHC embarked on the development and dissemination of a virtual CME/CE to promote vaccine confidence, access, and uptake in neurodivergent populations.

Sangre Brava at UCLA

Sangre Brava is a student-led organization committed to addressing the critical blood shortage at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center by engaging high schools across California in coordinated blood donation drives. Our primary focus is to inspire Latino and Latina students, who play a vital role in increasing donations from individuals with universal blood types. In addition to facilitating blood drives, we host workshops and information sessions at local schools and community centers to educate people about the importance of blood donation, dispel common myths, and underscore the life-saving impact for both donors and recipients. Beyond our blood donation efforts, Sangre Brava is dedicated to supporting educational equity. We organize fundraising initiatives to help students cover the costs of mandatory academic supplies, such as textbooks, lab coats, and goggles. By easing these financial burdens, we empower students to focus on their education without the stress of material constraints. Through these combined efforts, Sangre Brava seeks to create a lasting, positive impact on both public health and academic success.

Science Lab Teaching Club at UCLA

The Science Lab Teaching Club was formed at UCLA Department of Physics and Astronomy in January 2012 under the scientific guidance of Dr. Konstantin Belov with several goals in mind, including: partially compensate the loss of the science teaching faculty at local public schools due to severe budget cuts; provide teaching experience for the undergraduate students majoring in physics and astronomy; spark interest in science in the next generation. The club members meet weekly during the school year to prepare lessons and practice lab demonstrations. The lessons on different STEM subjects are taught by the club members at local schools, catering to the interests of students of all age ranges. The emphasis is on teaching students in K-5 branches of physics such as electricity, magnetism, waves, and optics; however, we often branch out to other fields in STEM. Each lesson is accompanied by several spectacular demonstrations using the real laboratory equipment provided by the Department’s demo lab as well as presentations and additional demos designed and built by the club members. The club members strongly believe that in order to get children interested in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) subjects, science education should start at a very early age and each lesson should become a memorable experience for the kids. Club members have given presentations at the following schools: Norra Sterry Elementary School, Citizens of the World Mar Vista Charter School, Emerson Middle School, Palms Middle School, Fairburn Elementary School, Brentwood Science Magnet Elementary, and others. Undergraduate club member Nick Vincent has expressed his own enthusiasm for the program. "The Science Teaching Club at UCLA gave me a great way to become involved in the community," said Nick. "It encouraged me to use my passion for science to benefit local elementary schools. I think that my work with the Science Teaching Club has greatly augmented my education. The community service aspect has enriched my overall academic experience, the social aspect has allowed me to meet other physics students, and the cerebral challenge of designing quantum mechanics demonstrations for elementary school students truly engaged my mind."

Splash@UCLA

Splash@UCLA is dedicated to revealing the joy of teaching to university students and preserving the love of learning of high schoolers in the greater LA community by providing fun and accessible educational programming. At Splash, which is a one-day educational outreach program that takes place on UCLA's campus, UCLA students get to design and teach their own class about anything they are are passionate about, in their own style. Then, motivated and curious high school students take ownership of their own education and broaden their horizons by learning from UCLA students! The classes can range from anything fun and non-academic--such as Chinese Chess and Rhythm Gaming--to the most challenging academic--such as Genetics and Quantum Mechanics. We also strive to reach students in underserved communities and open new avenues for higher education by providing informative courses on college admissions and financial aid, as well as "life in college" courses taught by current students from various backgrounds. We invite you to come join our community of teachers and learners at the cutting-edge of making a difference in education!

Student Stroke Force

Recognizing the community need for stroke public education and awareness, the UCLA Stroke Force was formed in 1992 under the leadership and guidance of the late Dr. Sidney Starkman, Head of UCLA Emergency Neurology and Emergency Medicine Director of the UCLA Stroke Center. In the Stroke Force program, undergraduates are involved in double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter research projects investigating the efficacy of various drugs and procedures applied to the patients that arrive in the UCLA Emergency Room with onset of acute ischemic stroke. Students serve as research associates and work alongside neurologists during code strokes. Responsibilities include collecting information relating to the patient’s medical history and neurological deficits in order to identify potential candidates for enrollment in clinical trials that aim to find novel treatments for stroke. Students also serve as speakers who reach out to various communities. To date, more than 200 students have participated in the program, delivering over 300 lectures to over 7000 individuals. Formal testing has demonstrated that these presentations are highly effective, resulting in a significant increase in post-education stroke awareness. Through integrating experiences from clinical exposure in the Ronald Reagan Emergency Department, neurological rounds, health fairs, and presentations, this sect of the Stroke Program strives to provide a force to minimize response time and to facilitate treatment.

Swipe Out Hunger

At UCLA, Swipe Out Hunger is committed to addressing food insecurity among students and the broader community through advocacy, education, and direct service. Our mission is to ensure that every student has access to nutritious food by organizing the Swipes Drive and administering a meal voucher program, as well as engaging in other initiatives that reduce food insecurity and minimize food waste across the greater LA area. Through the Swipes Drive, held at the end of each quarter, students with meal plans can donate unused meal swipes that would otherwise go unused. These swipes are redistributed to food-insecure students living off-campus. In the past year alone, we’ve collected over 100,000 meal swipes! Our organization also runs various volunteer programs, including gleaning fresh produce from local farmers' markets, organizing large-scale meal preparation events to raise awareness about food insecurity, preparing meals for women's and veterans' shelters, and participating in food justice and activism efforts on and off campus.

TechUp at UCLA

TechUp at UCLA is a student-run organization with the sole mission of the advocacy of technology literacy within the local community. It is an extension of a local non-profit, TechUp Los Angeles. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been forced to shift to remote working and video meetings that require some tech literacy skills. Yet, people experiencing homelessness may not have access to the technology needed to grow these skills. Given the existing hardships and disadvantages in the job market, learning tech literacy skills would help increase the amount and types of jobs this population can apply for. This can also be applied to other populations that struggle with tech literacy skills such as people from low income areas, elderly adults, and those who are returning from incarceration. While growing in tech literacy cannot knock down every barrier, having basic tech literacy skills brings us one step closer to an inclusive job market. Today, TechUp LA has partnered with seven local organizations throughout LA County where we provide monthly workshops to individuals on the basics of smartphones and computers. Thus, TechUp at UCLA hopes to amplify TechUp LA’s mission at UCLA and offer volunteer opportunities to current students to knock down technology barriers for underserved communities together.

Teens for Screens at UCLA

As part of efforts to come up with a new model for community outreach about breast cancer, UCSF's San Francisco Cancer Initiative Breast Cancer Task Force (SFCAN) discussed the idea of Teens for Screens (T4S) in 2018. In the course of numerous meetings and collaboration with community-based organizations geared toward the underserved population of San Francisco, the concept of creating a sustainable model of outreach to raise awareness of breast cancer among youth to educate their families and communities was developed. In addition to the support of SFCAN through the funding and resources they provided, the T4S pilot program would not have been possible without the leadership of Dr. Laura Fejerman, Dr. Ana Velasquez, Tania Dugatkin, and UCSF staff. We recognize them for the time, passion, support, and dedication they have contributed to T4S. In the Fall of 2019, T4S launched and empowered high school students with information to advocate for breast cancer screenings and healthy behaviors among their friends, families, and communities. In this vein, Teens for Screens at UCLA has adopted this model with a twist. To implement this model, UCLA Teens for Screens seeks to train undergraduate students as breast cancer educators to have them educate middle and high schoolers locally either in-person or remotely. As part of our outreach efforts, we aim to partner with high schools with high populations of underserved groups, such as low-income students and minorities, to provide them with information about breast cancer and the importance of screening. We also aim to provide one-on-one mentorship, with a culminating capstone project at the end of each program. As we continue this journey behind Teens for Screens, we hope that we can spread awareness about an often under-discussed, yet important issue.

The Westwood Food Cooperative

The WWFC is a mission-driven club whose goal is to create a more just and sustainable food system. We envision a world where farmers & growers are compensated fairly for their labor; where soil and land are treated as the invaluable resources that they are; and where all people have access to culturally appropriate, locally grown, highly nutritious food for an affordable price. We’re challenging the unequal distribution of food access in our market, driven by the United States’ subsidization of commodity crops that prioritizes quantity and revenue over public health. Our CSA program provides a radical alternative to this system by supplying locally grown food to our student body that is affordable & accessible. Additionally, our programs aim to reconnect consumers with the land and people who grew the food they eat, as we believe that our most intimate connection to our planet is the food it grows for us. We are also committed to partnering with other campus clubs to provide fresh produce to food-insecure students. Lastly, we write and publish articles that spread awareness about sustainable and ethical farming.

TRUST @ UCLA

TRUST is a student-led organization at UCLA where undergraduate volunteers lead interactive workshops that help youth build better habits and take control of their time, attention, and well-being. We partner with schools, after-school programs, and youth-based nonprofits to host workshops throughout the school year on topics like stress management, time management, self-esteem, and exercise habits. Beyond leading workshops, members can join committees focused on curriculum design, research, and outreach to develop evidence-based workshop plans and expand our partnerships. At its core, TRUST believes that small habits build upon each other to create our lives, and we want to empower youth to take control of their habits before their habits take control of them, so they can build the lives they envision.

Undergraduate Math Council

The Undergraduate Math Council is a council made up of undergraduate students, directly affiliated with the UCLA Math Department. Mathematics, and STEM at large, often carries an air of exclusivity, particularly for students from underrepresented communities. The council aims to address these issues by (1) fostering more effective and streamlined communication between students and the Math Department and (2) promoting an inclusive, equitable, and diverse environment for UCLA Math students. For more details on the workings of the council, please refer to our proposal here: tinyurl.com/mathcouncilproposal

Yolotzonyo services high school youth and non-traditional continuation students by centering social justice, college readiness, and alternative career paths to academia In addition, Yolotzonyo conducts an annual community organizing internship where we develop UCLA undergraduate students as community organizers by introducing them to the practical tools of social and restorative justice. Through restorative justice we foster healthy discourse, relationships, and critical dialogue.

Zeta Phi Beta Sorority - Nu Lambda Chapter

Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Incorporated is an international, historically black Greek-lettered sorority founded on January 16, 1920 by five collegiate women at Howard University. The sorority was founded on the simple belief that sorority elitism and socializing should not overshadow the real mission for progressive organizations - to address societal mores, ills, prejudices, poverty, and health concerns of the day. We were founded on four principles that our members still demonstrate today: Scholarship, Service, Sisterhood, and Finer Womanhood. On January 23, 1982, seven collegiate women at the University of California, Los Angeles chartered the Nu Lambda Chapter of Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc. Ever since, the ladies of Zeta have exemplified the principles of Zeta through campus programs, community service, and in their own personal endeavors. For more information about membership or future events, please email us: uclazetas@gmail.com.
