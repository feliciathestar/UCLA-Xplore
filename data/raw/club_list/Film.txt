Mirrorball Productions

Mirrorball Productions was founded when a group of theater students wanted to venture into film-land. A group of undergraduate students filled with a love for storytelling and creativity, banded together to form a production company. These students were inspired by a screenwriting course they took over the summer that became the inaugural short film, "Cedar Mountain." This company was created for students who have any interest in art to expand and enrich the craft of production and filmmaking to any degree. Mirrorball focuses on telling original stories, illuminating new perspectives of all-too-common narratives. The group aims to collaborate with the entire student body and anyone with a desire to create!

Shining Stars: Horror Club at UCLA

Welcome to UCLA’s horror cinema club! This is a no-commitment social club for horror lovers, from routine trivia winners to baby bats. We screen one horror film each week, starting with easy viewings and working up to the most terrifying films Of All Time. Bring your blanket, pillow, and emotional support witches and get ready to scream! Also, prepare to indulge in horror-themed mocktails, field trips to LA’s most haunted locales, goth club nights (18+), year-round Halloween extravaganzas, and late night debriefs in our very own bat cave. Subgenre preferences, best days for meetings, allergies, and favorite movies will all be polled for early on. Note: this is a safe space! Trigger warnings will be provided well before each screening, but these are optional (we understand if you want the suspense).
