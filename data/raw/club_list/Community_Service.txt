Bruin Initiative

Bruin Initiative was founded in 2007 to encourage UCLA students to actively work toward alleviating educational disparities through all avenues possible, particularly by preparing high school students for standardized tests and the college admissions process. Children growing up in poverty frequently have lower test scores than their higher-income counterparts, and as the years increase, the education gap continues to widen considerably. As an organization, we aim to help lessen this educational gap by providing educational resources and supplies and offering AP exam preparation and college-admissions instruction for high school students. Our volunteers come from all kinds of majors and backgrounds! Our organization is always looking for members who can provide assistance in our group-teaching programs, our curriculum design projects, and our one-on-one engagement opportunities.

We have two programs: a strategy consulting division and an investment fund. These programs work together to carry out quarterly projects where we partner with a small business in the Greater Los Angeles area, help them get a zero-interest microloan up to $15,000 on kiva.org, and provide strategy consulting services to help them succeed with the loan funds. Through this, we help borrowers change their lives financially while providing members with hands-on business experience. Our organization is a chapter of Kiva.org, a non-profit microfinance organization that provides microloans to people in need worldwide, especially in developing nations. These loans create opportunities for individuals to change their lives by jump-starting businesses, funding higher education, paying medical bills, and more. Once borrowers are successful, they repay their loans to the Kiva organization, where their funds are reused to create new opportunities, continuing the microloan cycle.

Bruin Partners

Bruin Partners is a one-on-one tutoring and mentoring program that serves the students at JFK High School, Phoenix Continuation High School, and Whitman Continuation High School. For middle school sites, we pair a UCLA volunteer with a middle school student with the goal that they will build a strong relationship that will continue throughout the mentee's middle school career, and influence the mentee's plans and decisions regarding higher education while also providing academic and character support. In our High School Component, we focus on college preparation with SAT and ACT tutoring and curriculum assistance, along with guidance regarding financial aid resources and college applications. Site visits entail one hour of tutoring (e.g. homework help and supplemental learning activities) in order to help the student with anything they're struggling with academically, or one hour of a planned activity. These activities include sports, arts and crafts, group discussions, games and science experiments, in order to help facilitate communication between the mentee/mentor pairs and foster a more interpersonal relationship, as well as expose our mentees to an array of enriching experiences.

Classroom Care

Classroom Care is a non-profit organization and current club at Chatsworth Charter High School (CCHS) that utilizes communities of motivated students to work together in order to create seasonal gift bags for children at schools in low-income communities while making fun, kid-friendly Youtube videos that include craft tutorials, book readings, and entertaining games for the children to watch in class. I started Classroom Care during the summer of 2022 in order to spread joy to children in low-income communities. After completing my sophomore year of high school, I reflected on my past and remembered the many fond memories of my childhood that I currently hold onto. Because these memories have comforted me on my path towards adulthood, I believe that all children are deserving of creating special memories they can carry with them as they grow older, regardless of their family’s financial position. I reached out to my fellow students at CCHS to form a student-led board to help me run the Classroom Care club and by using Classroom Care’s Instagram account, I was able to generate interest in the club and find members who shared a common interest in helping younger generations. As Classroom Care grew, I raised funds from friends and family through Snap Raise and held fundraisers at local restaurants who gave the organization a percentage of the profits. I also created classroomcare.org, which allows more people to donate to the organization online. Due to the additional funding of over $4,000 raised, Classroom Care was able to expand its services into more classrooms, allowing more students to be included. Club members would also visit the students in person, first thing in the morning, before our high school opened at 10:00 am on Tuesdays. We would read books to the kids and bring craft projects to do with them. After Classroom Care’s first year, the club board decided to create a Youtube Channel in order to reach students that we were unable to visit in person, specifically because CCHS eliminated late-start Tuesdays which made it more difficult to do personal class visits. Each monthly video is dedicated to a holiday or season. Members in the videos are dressed according to that month’s theme, and they are filmed packing the students’ gifts, reading children’s books, making a no-bake treat, partaking in challenges, and walking the kids through a craft tutorial for a craft that each student receives beforehand in their gift package. The videos are designed to be played by the students’ teacher, who distributes our gift packages to them. To further expand Classroom Care, I wrote a children’s book, Peach Pit, that was inspired by the students I have met while visiting their classrooms. The kids get very excited when I read them stories, so I decided to write a book that they could enjoy and learn from. The book was released on Amazon in December of 2023 and 100% of the profits go towards Classroom Care. At UCLA, I would like to continue my passion for volunteer work for children and expand the organization's reach by generating a larger volume of club members who are also dedicated to making an impact in the lives of so many young students. I want to continue utilizing my creativity by filming and editing Youtube videos, creating media, and planning club events while also regularly visiting classrooms in person. With the combined efforts of UCLA students, Classroom Care can increase its influence and make use of the ideas of students from all different backgrounds.

First and foremost, we recognize the importance of human connections in academic success. The Fulbright Network therefore seeks to create opportunities where long-lasting friendships can blossom. We hope it will be a site for intellectual exchange, where individuals can get a deeper appreciation of diverse perspectives. We also strive to support Fulbrighters with the often overwhelming logistics involved with moving to a new country. As a community, we can navigate the bumpy yet transformative journey we embarked on together. The Fulbright Network hopes to be a resource and make a positive impact on Fulbrighters’ new and exciting chapter in the United States.

Habitat for Humanity is an international nonprofit organization founded to help alleviate housing insecurity by building affordable homes and strong, safe, and stable communities. Our UCLA chapter works with Habitat for Humanity Greater Los Angeles and Homes4Families to help create these communities around the LA area, targeting the homeless veteran demographic. We help homeless/housing insecure veterans by organizing biweekly build days that consist of traveling to a ‘build site’ where UCLA student volunteers will assist in tasks essential to forming the neighborhood. These various tasks include installing windows, digging pipeline trenches, and even mixing and pouring concrete. We also help at Habitat Re:Stores where we help sort donations of furniture and supplies from individuals and companies to sell to the public at a fraction of the retail price. Thus, diverting reusable household items from landfills, and further funding Habitat construction projects.

Happy Feet Clinic

How to help L.A.’s homeless? One foot at a time. Without homes or any mode of transportation, hundreds of homeless people walk an average of 13 miles a day. Some walk for days, weeks, or months without having access to basic necessities such as clean water or properly fitted shoes. Many even refuse to air out their feet, conducive of many foot problems, afraid that their shoes might get stolen. As we, Happy Feet Clinic, provide those basic necessities and more, we are blessed with a powerfully humbling experience. At shelters around Los Angeles, including the Union Rescue Mission in downtown L.A., the Ocean Park Community Center in Santa Monica, the New Image Emergency Shelter in South LA, and PATH in Westwood, we treat hundreds of homeless people to a soothing foot wash in a tub of warm, soapy water. Next, we work side by side with podiatrists as they administer foot exams for the homeless community. Throughout the process, we interact with a variety of people in need of help and most importantly become aware of the large prominence of under-served communities and their critical need for assistance. For many students, it is hard to grasp how prominent this population is in a thriving country as America. At first, students squirm at the thought of washing feet (especially those that may need much more care than our own). As soon as the event comes to an end however, many are instilled with the feeling to return again and again. The power to help someone who has lost family, work, and shelter and put a smile on their face is an amazing feeling. This is what makes our organization unique. Any student with an interest in reaching out to under-served communities is invited to join.

Incarcerated Youth Tutorial Project (IYTP)

iYTP was formed in 1988 as part of the MSA (Muslim Student Association) to provide incarcerated juveniles with the opportunity to become productive members of society by accommodating these youth who have most fallen victim to depraved circumstances via mentoring, tutoring, and counseling services. iYTP focuses on encouraging incarcerated juveniles to pursue a secondary education through a curriculum based GED tutoring, and on decreasing recidivism rates by counseling and mentoring students in developing and reevaluating their life trajectories. We take privileged students, like you, from UCLA (and abroad) to Camp Gonzales in Malibu to tutor, mentor, and counsel these underprivileged students. We also work with Felicitas and Gonzalo Mendez High School in Boyle Heights to tutor and mentor at-risk students. The goal of this tutoring is to help these students receive their high school diploma opening the doors to more educational opportunities.

Kids Korner at UCLA

Kids Korner is a community service organization committed to enhancing educational opportunities for underserved youth in Los Angeles. We foster a passion for learning and academic curiosity among our students through tutoring and mentorship. During our general meetings, members collaborate together to create a personalized curriculum for every student through forms of worksheets, writing exercises, and interactive presentations. These materials are then taken to our weekly sites, where we also promote social skills and creativity through activities like arts and crafts, science experiments, recreational games, and discussions. Kids Korner also hosts quarterly educational field trips that are free of cost to our service recipients to provide broader learning opportunities and foster stronger relationships between the volunteers and children. By working with the same group of students over time, Kids Korner provides a unique and valuable experience for members, allowing them to witness the growth of the children they tutor and mentor. This not only deepens UCLA students' understanding of the impact of education on youth but also helps them form meaningful connections with the families in the communities we serve.

Maternal and Pediatric Community Outreach Nursing Organization at UCLA

The Maternal and Pediatric Community Outreach Nursing Organization at UCLA “MAP” is a community of UCLA nursing students eager to improve the health and well being of the mothers and children among at-risk and underserved groups across Los Angeles. Our goals lie in direct engagement with the community through various initiatives such as volunteering, organizing donation drives, and partnering with local organizations aligned with our mission statement. Through awareness, advocacy, and outreach, we aim to make a positive and meaningful impact on the mothers and children of Los Angeles, with a particular focus on underserved communities. Our mission is to develop a community of future nurses passionate about advancing the quality of life for vulnerable mothers and children. By addressing both maternal and pediatric populations as one, we focus on the compassionate care of families as a whole. This holistic approach to community engagement vicariously empowers UCLA nursing students to embrace patient-centered nursing practice that considers the needs of the entire family and addresses the unique challenges faced by these groups. While there are a few nursing clubs at UCLA that target interests in either pediatric or women’s health nursing independently, the Maternal and Pediatric Community Outreach Nursing Organization distinguishes itself by embracing an action-oriented, community-based approach that recognizes the deep interconnectedness of mothers, children, and families within health and wellness. Our commitment extends beyond UCLA’s campus as we directly engage with the surrounding Los Angeles metropolitan area, with a focus on vulnerable populations. We strive for our members to be agents of engagement and change among at-risk or underserved groups, and to engage in the advocacy and community involvement they will carry into their future nursing care.

Project Lux

Project Lux is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to bridging the gap between healthcare and houselessness. One of the ways we accomplish this is through directly assisting individuals experiencing houselessness access health insurance. By becoming Certified Enrollment Counselors (CECs) through Covered California, members enroll unhoused clients into programs such as Medi-Cal at a variety of different shelters/organizations on a weekly basis. Our current sites include the Skid Row Community Refresh Spot and the Westwood Public Library. We also assemble care packages with food/water and other basic necessities, distributing them directly to the unhoused community. At our enrollment fairs, we provide additional resources including referrals to nearby clinics in which members can point clients towards the care that they need. Moreover, we provide bus passes to make traveling to clinics and other resources more accessible. Lastly, we focus on advocacy, curating useful resources, and calling for change at a higher level. We hope that this multifaceted approach to aiding the unhoused community will help us create a ripple of change.

The Diya Project

The Diya Project is a humanitarian organization that helps fund the education of underprivileged students in Tunisia. We host fundraisers to raise money, which is then used to purchase backpacks and fill them up with all the school supplies each student needs for the entire school year. This includes all of their textbooks, notebooks, a whiteboard/chalkboard, a ruler, a drawing pad, markers, paints, a pencil pouch filled with pens, pencils, erasers, a correction pen, and so much more! Over the past few years, we have funded the education of over 350 students in Tunisia, grades K-12. We distribute them directly to the students’ homes, which are located in very rural locations. Many students aren’t able to attend school due to the financial burden that comes with it, so we work to relieve them of this stress and make sure they get the education they deserve.

Projects receive direct advisory, transportation and resource support from CSC to strengthen their service efforts. Throughout the year, CSC staff members plan Alternative Break immersion trips, Volunteer Day, Servocacy Fest, Project Bruin, Nonprofit Networking Night, teach-ins and advocacy campaigns. We also partner with other campus organizations and UCLA administration (e.g. Volunteer Center) to co-program service events. Through the Commissioner, we have a voice on USAC to represent service-minded students across campus. Our overall mission is to better the Los Angeles & global community with both direct service and advocacy, and to educate and inspire fellow students to do the same.

Vietnamese Community Health Project at UCLA

Vietnamese Community Health aspires to address the issue of preventative health through education, free services, and screenings in the Orange County and greater Los Angeles area. We attempt to accomplish this in three ways: promoting awareness of prevalent health issues affecting low-income families with minimal access to healthcare in southern California; ensuring the growth and expansion of community health by informing and empowering the volunteers and general UCLA members through education and awareness; and collaborating with other health projects from UCLA and the Vietnamese Community of southern California to provide services and host events that would benefit the Vietnamese and other socio-economically disadvantaged communities. Volunteers work with health professionals, build leadership in health-related community service, interact with patients, become educated on predominant community health issues, and have workshops to help make them strong leaders in the health field and community. VCH members will be provided with numerous opportunities for community service, leadership development, and mentorship opportunities. Community service opportunities include quarterly VCH-sponsored health fairs, biweekly health sites, and participation at community health fairs sponsored by non-profit organizations that VCH partners with. In addition, there is a leadership development "internship" offered each winter quarter. In the program, interns learn about the challenges and rewards that VCH staff members face when making decisions and working collaboratively in a group environment. Interns get the opportunity to apply for a position on VCH staff, as well as a Committee Head; nonetheless, the skills gained from the internship are easily applicable to any other leadership and management position.

Volunteer Income Tax Assistance

VITA at UCLA is a non-profit organization that has been serving the West Los Angeles community since 1987. Our goal is to provide income tax return assistance to those in need. We are committed to helping UCLA staff, undergraduate and graduate students, as well as anyone in nearby communities in need of tax assistance and education. Our target community population includes those in the Los Angeles community who fit any of the following descriptions: low-to-moderate income, elderly, disabled, non-English speaking, or individuals who are simply uninformed about the tax process. Almost everyone living in the United States must file both Federal and State taxes each year. The income tax filing process can be confusing and is often time consuming. It is important that returns are filed correctly so that the tax laws are followed, which may be difficult to do due to the confusing tax code. It has been and continues to be the goal of our program to help people with their taxes and educate them in the procedure of filing a return to help clarify the process and provide assistance to those who otherwise would go without aid. We offer UCLA students: • A great opportunity to give back to the community while gaining hands-on experience • Free training on individual income tax preparation • Strong resume builder with tax experience and community service • An opportunity to network with accounting/tax/consulting firms • IRS Certification
