Founded by Daniel Haiem and Katie Mowris in the summer of 2015, the mission of The Bruin Experiment is to inspire scientific curiosity in the underserved youth through the orchestration of self-initiated science fairs. By providing a medium where students can interact in a fun, safe and educational manner, we aim to encourage them to view science as more than intimidating textbooks. During the fall and winter quarters, we visit selected Title I schools over 15 weeks to help our students guide their projects. We then invite the students to UCLA for a science fair in the spring quarter, where they may showcase their findings to proud parents, fellow students, and faculty.

Bruin Initiative

Bruin Initiative was founded in 2007 to encourage UCLA students to actively work toward alleviating educational disparities through all avenues possible, particularly by preparing high school students for standardized tests and the college admissions process. Children growing up in poverty frequently have lower test scores than their higher-income counterparts, and as the years increase, the education gap continues to widen considerably. As an organization, we aim to help lessen this educational gap by providing educational resources and supplies and offering AP exam preparation and college-admissions instruction for high school students. Our volunteers come from all kinds of majors and backgrounds! Our organization is always looking for members who can provide assistance in our group-teaching programs, our curriculum design projects, and our one-on-one engagement opportunities.

Bruin Partners

Bruin Partners is a one-on-one tutoring and mentoring program that serves the students at JFK High School, Phoenix Continuation High School, and Whitman Continuation High School. For middle school sites, we pair a UCLA volunteer with a middle school student with the goal that they will build a strong relationship that will continue throughout the mentee's middle school career, and influence the mentee's plans and decisions regarding higher education while also providing academic and character support. In our High School Component, we focus on college preparation with SAT and ACT tutoring and curriculum assistance, along with guidance regarding financial aid resources and college applications. Site visits entail one hour of tutoring (e.g. homework help and supplemental learning activities) in order to help the student with anything they're struggling with academically, or one hour of a planned activity. These activities include sports, arts and crafts, group discussions, games and science experiments, in order to help facilitate communication between the mentee/mentor pairs and foster a more interpersonal relationship, as well as expose our mentees to an array of enriching experiences.

We are a student-run organization that empowers undergraduates to engage directly with pressing policy issues through research, writing, discussion, and professional development. BUPR provides a platform for students of all academic backgrounds and political perspectives to analyze public policy in depth, develop their voice as policy thinkers, and contribute to meaningful public dialogue. We believe that policy is at the heart of how society addresses its greatest challenges—whether it’s regulating artificial intelligence, reforming healthcare systems, reducing economic inequality, addressing climate change, or strengthening democratic institutions. Our mission is to help UCLA students not only understand these issues, but actively participate in the conversations that shape their outcomes. BUPR operates on three central pillars: 1. Publishing – Our online journal regularly publishes high-quality student-written articles and op-eds on a wide range of policy topics. Every article is edited collaboratively and held to high standards of evidence, clarity, and argumentation. Writers may choose to analyze existing legislation, examine the implications of a particular policy proposal, or compare different approaches to a societal challenge. We publish both analytical features and shorter, opinion-driven pieces—allowing students to explore a topic with depth or express a clear policy stance supported by research. 2. Legislative Newsletter – Each week, BUPR distributes a student-produced newsletter that highlights key legislative developments in various sectors, including technology, health, education, environment, and economic policy. Sector Leads track federal and state-level developments, summarize the core elements of proposed or passed bills, and offer brief context on their potential implications. The newsletter aims to help students stay informed about fast-moving policy landscapes in a concise, accessible format. 3. Speaker Events and Career Development – To connect academic inquiry with professional pathways, BUPR hosts speaker events featuring experts across the policy landscape. These include analysts from think tanks, government officials, attorneys, legislative staffers, nonprofit leaders, and others working at the intersection of policy and practice. Events are held either over Zoom or in person and are designed to expose students to a variety of career paths while creating opportunities to network with professionals in the field. We also plan resume-building workshops, internship panels, and career Q&As. Organizational Structure: BUPR is entirely student-led and structured to encourage collaboration and leadership development. The organization is overseen by an executive board consisting of the President, Vice President, Director of Publications, Treasurer, Director of Outreach, and a team of Sector Leads. Each Sector Lead manages a policy area (e.g., Economic Policy, Tech Policy, Health Policy), guides writers, and contributes to the weekly newsletter. Editors support writers through research help, feedback, and article development. We are proudly bipartisan and inclusive, providing space for a wide range of ideological perspectives—as long as arguments are grounded in evidence, respectful discourse, and a sincere interest in public policy. Our editorial standards prioritize analytical rigor, respectful debate, and intellectual humility. How to Get Involved: All UCLA undergraduate students are welcome to apply to join BUPR. We accept new members at the beginning of each quarter, though students may express interest at any time. Opportunities include becoming a: Staff Writer: Contribute 1–2 articles per quarter on topics of your choice, with support from Sector Leads and editors. Sector Lead: Manage a policy area, support writers, and compile weekly legislative updates. Editor: Work with writers to develop content and maintain publication quality. Outreach or Events Team Member: Help promote our work, recruit members, and organize speaker sessions We are especially excited to work with students who are passionate about policy but may not have formal writing experience—our editorial process is collaborative and designed to help students grow as thinkers and communicators.

Building Heroes Project at UCLA

Building Heroes aims to educate the underserved community about medical emergencies. Club members will learn to lead participants through hands on skill training designed to give them the means to help control medical emergencies before EMS arrives. Club members will also help participants understand when something is a medical emergency and when they should seek help. Each site we visit will also be provided with a list of contacts for medical and psychological help within their immediate area. Besides the hands on style skills training, we will also offer free Red Cross Adult and Pediatric First Aid/CPR/AED certification to any participants seeking official certification. In addition to community outreach, this club also aims to collect data from the underserved community and participate in a longitudinal research study. Club members will create surveys and collect data before and after visiting sites. The study will focus on participants experience with medical emergencies, their level of preparedness, and their willingness to help. Lastly, we want to work on creating first aid kits tailored to the homeless and underserved communities. These will be handed out to all participants who complete our program. Through Building Heroes, club members will gain a deeper understanding of first aid techniques, and learn how to lead hands on discussions and lectures. In addition, they will gain important field research experience. Perhaps most rewarding, club members will be given the chance to make a difference in the underserved community by sharing life saving knowledge.

Cardiology Interest Group at DGSOM

STATEMENT OF PURPOSE - The goal of the Cardiology Interest Group is to expose future physicians to different fields within cardiology at an early stage in training. To do so, we will organize regular sessions during which leaders in their field have an opportunity to speak to first- and second-year medical students about their work and the current trends in the field of cardiology. Students will benefit by getting early exposure to cardiology, plus the privilege to hear some wonderful doctors whom they would not otherwise come in contact with so early in their training. We will also provide shadowing opportunities, enabling students to get hands-on experience with cardiology patients. Lastly, the Cardiology Interest Group will provide opportunities for medical students to get to know cardiology fellows and attending physicians through social events and mixers, thus creating a collegial atmosphere to foster interest in cardiology. We hope this group will spark interest in pursuing a career path in one of the cardiology specialties to balance the growing need for cardiologists both in the clinical and research realms. PROVISION TO MAKE FINANCIAL RECORDS AVAILABLE - We will make financial records available to university administrators upon request. UC NONDISCRIMINATION STATEMENT – Cardiology Interest Group does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, gender identity, pregnancy, disability, age, medical condition (cancer-related), ancestry, marital status, citizenship, sexual orientation, or status as a Vietnam-era veteran or special disabled veteran. This also prohibits sexual harassment. ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE (officers) – A minimum of three officers (co-coordinators) will be elected leaders in the organization in each academic year, up to a maximum of eight officers based on student interest. Officers will be elected at the beginning of each academic year. The membership of the organization shall consist of any UCLA undergraduate or graduate student. All officers of the student organizations must be current UCLA undergraduates or graduate students. Officers found not to be a current UCLA student will be removed immediately. ELIGIBILITY FOR VOTING PRIVILEGES and VOTING PROCEDURES – officers will vote annually on changes to the constitution. PROCEDURES FOR AMENDING THE CONSTITUTION – changes to the constitution will be made upon a simple majority vote by the officers.

Classroom Care

Classroom Care is a non-profit organization and current club at Chatsworth Charter High School (CCHS) that utilizes communities of motivated students to work together in order to create seasonal gift bags for children at schools in low-income communities while making fun, kid-friendly Youtube videos that include craft tutorials, book readings, and entertaining games for the children to watch in class. I started Classroom Care during the summer of 2022 in order to spread joy to children in low-income communities. After completing my sophomore year of high school, I reflected on my past and remembered the many fond memories of my childhood that I currently hold onto. Because these memories have comforted me on my path towards adulthood, I believe that all children are deserving of creating special memories they can carry with them as they grow older, regardless of their family’s financial position. I reached out to my fellow students at CCHS to form a student-led board to help me run the Classroom Care club and by using Classroom Care’s Instagram account, I was able to generate interest in the club and find members who shared a common interest in helping younger generations. As Classroom Care grew, I raised funds from friends and family through Snap Raise and held fundraisers at local restaurants who gave the organization a percentage of the profits. I also created classroomcare.org, which allows more people to donate to the organization online. Due to the additional funding of over $4,000 raised, Classroom Care was able to expand its services into more classrooms, allowing more students to be included. Club members would also visit the students in person, first thing in the morning, before our high school opened at 10:00 am on Tuesdays. We would read books to the kids and bring craft projects to do with them. After Classroom Care’s first year, the club board decided to create a Youtube Channel in order to reach students that we were unable to visit in person, specifically because CCHS eliminated late-start Tuesdays which made it more difficult to do personal class visits. Each monthly video is dedicated to a holiday or season. Members in the videos are dressed according to that month’s theme, and they are filmed packing the students’ gifts, reading children’s books, making a no-bake treat, partaking in challenges, and walking the kids through a craft tutorial for a craft that each student receives beforehand in their gift package. The videos are designed to be played by the students’ teacher, who distributes our gift packages to them. To further expand Classroom Care, I wrote a children’s book, Peach Pit, that was inspired by the students I have met while visiting their classrooms. The kids get very excited when I read them stories, so I decided to write a book that they could enjoy and learn from. The book was released on Amazon in December of 2023 and 100% of the profits go towards Classroom Care. At UCLA, I would like to continue my passion for volunteer work for children and expand the organization's reach by generating a larger volume of club members who are also dedicated to making an impact in the lives of so many young students. I want to continue utilizing my creativity by filming and editing Youtube videos, creating media, and planning club events while also regularly visiting classrooms in person. With the combined efforts of UCLA students, Classroom Care can increase its influence and make use of the ideas of students from all different backgrounds.

Clinical and Translational Science Institute-Research Associate Program

The CTSI (Clinical Translational Science Institution) Research Associates Program (RAP) is a pilot program that provides undergraduates exposure to hospital based medicine as well as clinical research. As a research associate, RAP members play a key role in the implementation and maintenance of research protocols in their respective study locations (e.g. the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU), under Pulmonary and Critical Care Physicians at RRH). We are given the opportunity to make rounds with the medical team, observe common procedures, and experience didactic teaching sessions during the course of the research day. As a result, the aim is to become comfortable with the workings of a hospital and gain skills in professionalism, patient communication, and research methodology. This program was established by Dr. Elizabeth Turner (critical care, pulmonary disease) in association with the Clinical and Translational Science Institution (CTSI). Currently CTSI-RAP and the clinical research training is led by Dr. Laurie Shaker-Irwin (CTSI advisor). Follow us on FB: https://www.facebook.com/CTSIRAP

Donation of Tissues and Organs (DotOrg)

DoT Org at UCLA together with Latinx/Chicanx for Community Medicine (LCCM) began as a student initiated effort to educate and increase consciousness within UCLA students and members of the surrounding communities concerning the myths and facts of organ and tissue donation. We hope to dispel common misconceptions and thus increase the pool of registered donors within the Los Angeles area. Our goal is to raise consciousness of organ and tissue donation through on and off campus events, which include the annual Donate Life Run/Walk, Give Life, Give Thanks donor drive, etc. With the collective effort of our volunteers, we hope to reach the community through public health fairs, pre-health conferences, LAUSD high school site visits, and other community-based sites in Los Angeles County.

Doula Project at UCLA

The UCLA Doula Project aims to support and train medical students to provide informational, physical, and emotional doula support to clients seeking pregnancy termination in the West Los Angeles area. In doing so, the program aims to supplement clinical training in reproductive health among medical trainees and provide hands-on, client-centered volunteer experiences at a partner family planning clinic. The Doula Project, now in its second year of operation at West Medical OBGYN (UCLA Family Planning Clinic), is a student-led organization that offers an annual abortion and loss doula training to DGSOM students that is facilitated by OBGYN faculty at UCLA and a community-based doula organization. The program operates year-round; trained student doulas take on volunteer shifts to offer in-person and virtual doula support to all patients at West Medical who opt into the program. Last year, volunteer medical student doulas provided support to over 80 patients seeking termination of pregnancy.

DREAM - Driving Resilience through Empowerment, Advocacy, Mentorship

Driving Resilience through Empowerment, Advocacy, and Mentorship (DREAM) is a student organization at the David Geffen School of Medicine that brings together UCLA medical students, undergraduates, and medical faculty to empower historically minoritized youth. As a key partner of Gardena High School's new Medical Emergency Services Academy (MESA), DREAM has worked closely with Gardena High School to provide medical and clinical skills training on ultrasound, clinical problem solving, and life-saving measures such as Stop the Bleed and overdose reversal. These trainings are critical, not only because they empower underserved youth to pursue careers in health medicine and slowly add to the mosaic of representation, but also because they propagate life-saving information throughout communities neglected by systems of healthcare and health education.

Everyday Responder Project @ UCLA

According to a study conducted in 2017, the average EMS response time is about 6 minutes. However, this number was roughly doubled in rural settings, with nearly 1 in 10 encounters resulting in a wait time of over half an hour. When applying these metrics to some of the leading causes of death in the emergency prehospital setting (cardiac arrest and traumatic bleeding), an issue becomes apparent – time. The brain begins to suffer damage after roughly 4 minutes without oxygen and progresses toward irreversible damage after about 7 minutes. There are about half a million deaths from cardiac arrest in the U.S. every year, but a study conducted in 2009 revealed that, out of 138 bystanders who called 911 for a cardiac-related emergency, about half of the cardiac arrests were not detected. Similar patterns can be observed in bleeding emergencies, with over one-third of mortality from all traumatic injuries being attributed to severe hemorrhage and roughly 50% of hemorrhage-related deaths occurring before reaching a hospital. With most medical emergencies benefitting from immediate intervention, an effective approach to improving patient outcomes involves placing everyday people at the forefront of the medical care team. Understanding how to effectively engage the emergency response system and provide basic first aid (i.e. bleed control and CPR) can drastically improve a patient’s likelihood of survival. Previous research has highlighted the efficacy of bystander training programs in improving patient outcomes and increasing bystander confidence in providing medical aid: “Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) by laypersons (so-called bystanders) improves the chances of survival by a factor of 2-4” - Current Opinion in Critical Care (2015). “The proportion of students showing willingness to perform BLS increased from 13% to 77% after \[training\] even when the collapsed person is a stranger” — Resuscitation (2016). With the aim of improving accessibility to bystander medical training, the Everyday Responder Project (ERP) was founded in December 2020 by two students at the University of Southern California. The current ERP team consists of a variety of healthcare, educational, and creative professionals who are passionate about developing and teaching medical content. With the help of ERP’s volunteers, the organization has begun to pilot its core curriculum and work on larger, longitudinal projects that will help improve medical literacy and emergency preparedness in the various communities across California and beyond.

Federalist Society

The Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies is a group of conservatives and libertarians interested in the current state of the legal order. It is founded on the principles that the state exists to preserve freedom, that the separation of governmental powers is central to our Constitution, and that it is emphatically the province and duty of the judiciary to say what the law is, not what it should be. The Society seeks both to promote an awareness of these principles and to further their application through its activities.

Kids Korner at UCLA

Kids Korner is a community service organization committed to enhancing educational opportunities for underserved youth in Los Angeles. We foster a passion for learning and academic curiosity among our students through tutoring and mentorship. During our general meetings, members collaborate together to create a personalized curriculum for every student through forms of worksheets, writing exercises, and interactive presentations. These materials are then taken to our weekly sites, where we also promote social skills and creativity through activities like arts and crafts, science experiments, recreational games, and discussions. Kids Korner also hosts quarterly educational field trips that are free of cost to our service recipients to provide broader learning opportunities and foster stronger relationships between the volunteers and children. By working with the same group of students over time, Kids Korner provides a unique and valuable experience for members, allowing them to witness the growth of the children they tutor and mentor. This not only deepens UCLA students' understanding of the impact of education on youth but also helps them form meaningful connections with the families in the communities we serve.

The goal of DM is to involve the UCLA campus community in the fight against Pediatric HIV/AIDS by raising funds and awareness to end mother-to-child transmission. We provide HIV education, work to end stigma, celebrate our collective power, and articulate our community’s role in the future of this fight. DM has become an iconic event within the UCLA community, so much that it's considered a “True Bruin Tradition.” Since its founding, PAC has raised over $6 million for our beneficiaries: The Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, The Laurel Foundation, and the UCLA AIDS Institute. In addition to planning and participating in DM, members of PAC participate in promotional events, fundraisers, and volunteer opportunities, both at UCLA and within the wider Los Angeles community. PAC is constantly seeking to unite students, activists, and leaders around our cause, and with 17 diverse committees, PAC has a place for you. We welcome any students passionate about creating an AIDS-free generation and working with an amazing team in the process; otherwise, we’ll see you at Dance Marathon!

Plant Futures at UCLA

Increasingly, young adults are recognizing the broad based potential of a plant-centric food system to (i) address the climate crisis directly and urgently, (ii) prevent and heal diet-related chronic diseases, and (iii) ease nutrition insecurity. Plant Futures Initiative aims to meet students at an opportune moment in their lives, helping them to become enlightened eaters and advocates for positive food systems transformation, and bridging education, advocacy, and right livelihood. Plant Futures has two purposes. 1. To educate others and increase awareness about the diverse facets and drivers of the plant-centric food systems including social justice, health benefits and environmental sustainability. 2. Partner with other organizations both on and off campus to facilitate learning and work towards implementing some changes towards a plant based food solution. The goal of Plant Futures is to build a community of students who are ethical leaders, systems thinkers and effective advocates for a plant-centric future. These students will have access to the Plant Futures network where they will ideally receive opportunities to meet with and work with companies and organizations beyond campus who are currently working on different plant based solutions. This organization is part of the larger organization of Plant Futures.

Science Lab Teaching Club at UCLA

The Science Lab Teaching Club was formed at UCLA Department of Physics and Astronomy in January 2012 under the scientific guidance of Dr. Konstantin Belov with several goals in mind, including: partially compensate the loss of the science teaching faculty at local public schools due to severe budget cuts; provide teaching experience for the undergraduate students majoring in physics and astronomy; spark interest in science in the next generation. The club members meet weekly during the school year to prepare lessons and practice lab demonstrations. The lessons on different STEM subjects are taught by the club members at local schools, catering to the interests of students of all age ranges. The emphasis is on teaching students in K-5 branches of physics such as electricity, magnetism, waves, and optics; however, we often branch out to other fields in STEM. Each lesson is accompanied by several spectacular demonstrations using the real laboratory equipment provided by the Department’s demo lab as well as presentations and additional demos designed and built by the club members. The club members strongly believe that in order to get children interested in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) subjects, science education should start at a very early age and each lesson should become a memorable experience for the kids. Club members have given presentations at the following schools: Norra Sterry Elementary School, Citizens of the World Mar Vista Charter School, Emerson Middle School, Palms Middle School, Fairburn Elementary School, Brentwood Science Magnet Elementary, and others. Undergraduate club member Nick Vincent has expressed his own enthusiasm for the program. "The Science Teaching Club at UCLA gave me a great way to become involved in the community," said Nick. "It encouraged me to use my passion for science to benefit local elementary schools. I think that my work with the Science Teaching Club has greatly augmented my education. The community service aspect has enriched my overall academic experience, the social aspect has allowed me to meet other physics students, and the cerebral challenge of designing quantum mechanics demonstrations for elementary school students truly engaged my mind."

Teddy Bear Hospital DGSOM

Mission Statement Teddy Bear Hospital DGSOM is a branch of the Teddy Bear Hospital USA (TBH) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization run by medical students and undergraduate students. Collectively, members aim to support the local community in promoting medical communication to help reduce clinical anxiety in children. Our various stations run as 'hospitals' for children's teddy bears and are designed as a hands-on experience that allows children to better understand healthcare, reduce medical associated fears, and inspire them to pursue higher education. Our organization offers allied-health students opportunities to practice working with children and experience teaching health care. Students learn important pediatric communication skills, such as building rapport and using child-friendly language. Volunteers diffuse complex medical information and explain important health questions to participating children. Vision In our Teddy Bear Hospital mock hospital sessions, children will bring a beloved teddy (or are loaned one) and treat their teddy bears with empathy, learn about patient care, and discover careers in medicine. Through our team, we strive for creating a fun and relaxed atmosphere to create a positive experience in medicine. With these interactions, TBH aims to ease any fears and anxieties concerning doctors' visits, hospital settings, and/or medical procedures. Objectives 1. Medical Literacy: Introducing children to healthcare concepts through interactive check-ups with their teddy bears. Through hands-on teaching, we empower kids with medical knowledge and encourage future careers in healthcare. 2. Community: Connecting children, undergraduates, medical students, nursing students, residents, physicians, and local healthcare professionals through engaging hospital sessions at elementary schools. Collecting support from various organizations to collaborate for a culture of health within the community 3. Well-Being: By creating a fun and relaxed environment, we help children overcome anxieties about medical visits. Our activities promote healthy habits and instill confidence, paving the way for lifelong positive attitudes toward healthcare. Unique Value Proposition Teddy Bear Hospital DGSOM is unique in that it utilizes a play based approach to encourage children to be involved in their healthcare. We hope to use this approach to foster interest in health and higher education specifically in low SES areas in LA county. We also want to use this to teach medical students how to interact with pediatric patients. Structure Each of the following positions are eligible for self-nomination. Leadership will be passed down year-to-year by application, interview, and leadership vote. Subcommittee lead positions will be created and dissolved as needed throughout the academic calendar, with a leadership vote of 50% or greater. President - Provide leadership and guidance for the organization for the entirety of the academic year - Organize biweekly meetings of membership - Act as the voice of the group in administration-facing discussions. - Advocate for the group, its mission, and the wellbeing of the wider LA community to DGSOM and other healthcare organizations serving LA - Create and review applications for leadership position replacements at the beginning of the consecutive academic year - Set policy, create timelines, and clarify goals for ongoing projects - Delegate action items to relevant subcommittee leads or individuals Vice-President - Cover for the president as needed - Organize the undergraduate cohort to help carry out our events - Assist with other needs on an as needed basis Treasurer - Keep records of any donations from outside organizations or funds allocated from UCLA SOLE - Meet regularly with subcommittees leads to determine funding needs - Delegate funding based on need, membership votes, and leadership decisions

The Diya Project

The Diya Project is a humanitarian organization that helps fund the education of underprivileged students in Tunisia. We host fundraisers to raise money, which is then used to purchase backpacks and fill them up with all the school supplies each student needs for the entire school year. This includes all of their textbooks, notebooks, a whiteboard/chalkboard, a ruler, a drawing pad, markers, paints, a pencil pouch filled with pens, pencils, erasers, a correction pen, and so much more! Over the past few years, we have funded the education of over 350 students in Tunisia, grades K-12. We distribute them directly to the students’ homes, which are located in very rural locations. Many students aren’t able to attend school due to the financial burden that comes with it, so we work to relieve them of this stress and make sure they get the education they deserve.

Club management operates strictly on a volunteer basis. Since the club’s founding in 2008, membership has been open to all UCLA students and affiliates. There are currently around 10 members. Meetings are two hours once per week, consisting of beginner and intermediate dance lessons as well as social dancing. The group is fortunate to have two talented and experienced volunteer dance instructors that teach lessons at every meeting. Outside of meetings, the club organizes on-campus events open to all students, and trips to off-campus venues like “Lindy Groove” and “Third Saturday Swing” in Pasadena.
