Master of Healthcare Administration Student Association (MHASA) at UCLA

The Master of Healthcare Administration Student Association (MHASA) is a student-led initiative explicitly crafted for the health administration graduate student body at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health. This organization pioneers an in-person and virtual collaborative environment that connects various student cohorts, fostering stronger relationships among students and faculty within the health policy management department. This effort is especially critical given the predominantly remote format of our program, which naturally restricts face-to-face networking opportunities. MHASA is dedicated to collating and voicing course feedback collectively and devising tailored professional development opportunities for our members, who typically balance their studies with full-time professional commitments. Our goal is to enhance their academic achievements and equip them with the leadership skills necessary for their future success.

SWC Body Image Task Force

The aim of the Body Image Task Force is to help the entire UCLA student body combat issues of body image. We do so by hosting events, workshops, and speakers that tackle issues such as exercise, eating disorders, body dysmorphia, mental health, and self esteem. Living as college students in Los Angeles, we want to help students understand how influenced we all are by media images and we want to give students the tools to combat these influences. The media has given us a specific image of what is beautiful, and we want to encourage every student on campus to feel confident and beautiful no matter how their body looks. By improving our self esteem, we can focus less time on our physical appearance and more time on living our lives. We hope to enhance the self esteem of students by demonstrating beauty isn’t only skin-deep, and by pushing students to be positive with themselves and not to be so critical. We also want to show how physical health affects mental health. We want to teach students ways to take care of their own health which will help them feel better. For instance we emphasize healthy eating and fitness, but encourage individuals to focus on feeling good rather than looking good. We want to make help accessible to those who are struggling with body dismorphia or eating disorders. Through our programming, we hope to educate the student body on these issues and how to tackle them. The Body Image Task Force also aims to help students learn how to handle college stress. We hope to provide stress outlets because we believe that mental health is also connected to self esteem and in general happiness. As students, we all face a variety of obstacles that can ultimately hold us back. We hope to reduce these personal barriers to help each student here reach their full potential.

HNF’s goal is to improve student welfare by teaching students how to incorporate healthy habits into their everyday routines. HNF can be seen as a Health – Nutrition – Fitness triangle. If one or more elements of the triangle are missing, the triangle is incomplete and the body suffers. Through unique programs and events, HNF focuses on bringing together all the elements of the triangle to provide students with a truly holistic approach to life.

SWC Student Education and Research of Contemporary Health

SEARCH: Student Education and Research on Contemporary Health—our name says it all. We know that there is a lot of research out there on health issues that are currently plaguing college students, but we want to cater out research and solutions specifically for the UCLA student body. Being a college student requires juggling academics, extra-curricular activities, work, friends, and family among a myriad of other things. Sometimes the health of the student gets pushed in the backseat in order to deal with these tasks, and students become sleep-deprived, consume energy drinks, abuse academic performance enhancement drug, and much, much more. Our goal is to find research studies and conduct our own research about healthy living styles and healthy alternatives to common choices and to disseminate this research to the UCLA student body so we can arm them with the tools they need to make the decisions that are best for them not only now, but also for the future.

We serve both as an umbrella organization for 32 student-run service projects, and a center for the service efforts of the campus community, using large-scale service programming, and advocacy & awareness initiatives to engage UCLA students in ethical service. CSC projects under our umbrella address issues within the community, using both direct service and advocacy to affect social change. Each of our projects focuses on a particular issue in areas ranging from poverty and homelessness, to education, to health, and beyond. Projects receive direct advisory, transportation and resource support from CSC to strengthen their service efforts. Throughout the year, CSC staff members plan Alternative Break immersion trips, Volunteer Day, Servocacy Fest, Project Bruin, Nonprofit Networking Night, teach-ins and advocacy campaigns. We also partner with other campus organizations and UCLA administration (e.g. Volunteer Center) to co-program service events. Through the Commissioner, we have a voice on USAC to represent service-minded students across campus. Our overall mission is to better the Los Angeles & global community with both direct service and advocacy, and to educate and inspire fellow students to do the same.

USAC Internal Vice President's Office

We seek to serve you, the students! As the representative organization for over 1000+ student organizations at UCLA, we are accordingly interested in promoting the varied interests of this diverse body. We recognize that this objective may seem formidable, ambitious even. After all, it is difficult to represent such a disparate array of clubs, teams and organizations. However, rather than bemoan such a daunting task, we are instead committed to embracing this immense diversity; which paints our campus in different strokes and which allows us both to appreciate the uniqueness within ourselves as well as in others. Moreover, we do not see UCLA as an isolated outpost in the greater Los Angeles area, disconnected and aloof from its surrounding environment. Instead, we see the two entities as active partners in a fruitful relationship that is continuing to evolve in significant and important ways. Thus, not only do we hope to advocate student engagement on campus, but we also hope to extend that engagement to the community of Los Angeles. As citizens and students of this active, moving city, we must recognize our own interdependence, our own parallel currents; we must become more conscious of the direction in which we are moving; and the Office of the Internal Vice President is committed to doing this.

USAC Transfer Student Representative

The Office of the Transfer Student Representative is one of 15 offices of the Undergraduate Student Association (USA). The role of the elected Transfer Student Representative is to be the voice that represents the undergraduate transfer student population to the USA Council. The office is meant to address the collective needs of the transfer student body and ensure those needs are met by student government and by the administration. Among other steps towards transfer justice, the Office of the TSR appoints transfers to campus-wide committees, presents Transfer Awareness Trainings, co-hosts Transfer Transitions, lobbies for transfer legislation at the state and national level, and works with other UCLA transfers and transfers across the UC to advocate for a more equitable university experience for transfers. This role was created in 2014 as a result of advocacy by the Transfer Leadership Coalition and stands as a symbol of the power transfers have at UCLA.
