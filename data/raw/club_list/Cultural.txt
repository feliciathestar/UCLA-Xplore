al-Arabiyya

At al-Arabiyya, we believe in the infinite creativity of language, echoing Noam Chomsky’s insight: “Language is a process of free creation; its laws and principles are fixed, but the manner in which the principles of generation are used is free and infinitely varied.” Our mission is to cultivate this freedom and creativity through the Arabic language, offering a vibrant space where students can explore its depth and beauty. Our organization nurtures language growth, helping members build fluency through engaging activities like weekly conversation circles. We celebrate cultural diversity, showcasing the rich traditions, dialects, and arts of the Arab world. Through creative expression, we host poetry readings, storytelling, and calligraphy workshops, encouraging members to connect with Arabic’s artistic heritage. We also delve into historical roots, exploring how periods like the pre-Islam, Umayyad, and Abbasid era shaped the language and its literature. Activities include cultural events, literary evenings, interactive workshops, and guest lectures by scholars and artists. Together, we create a supportive community where the Arabic language and its cultural legacy can thrive. al-Arabiyya is simply a space where the Arabic language and culture bloom together.

Foundations Choreography

Foundations Choreography was founded in 2014 to address a gap observed by our founders in UCLA’s dance community. The dance community was primarily dominated by competitive teams, and there wasn’t a space for beginner and intermediate dancers. Initially, the organization focused on hosting workshops and teaching fundamental hip-hop choreography to interested students. Then, the organization expanded to include beginner/intermediate training teams, allowing anyone interested in dance to grow, train, and challenge themselves in a safe space. This soon led to the introduction of Wintensive, an annual event where professional choreographers come to teach the UCLA community for free, fostering greater cultural and dance awareness. Now, the organization has quarterly training teams and celebrates their achievements during our quarterly showcases. We also host workshops every quarter to continue to inspire and educate more dancers with various cultural dances and techniques.

Hermanos Unidos De UCLA

Our Purpose and Mission Statement: We are a 501(c) Not-for-Profit organization that focuses on the retention and matriculation of Latino males in higher education. We seek to advance Latino males into academic scholars, community leaders, and prepare them for the professional world post-college. We shall achieve this by instilling the values represented by our three pillars: Academic Excellence, Community Service and Social Interaction. Through our three pillars, we are able to push our members to achieve “El Nuevo Hombre” which focuses on breaking down the most damaging cultural stereotypes and the machista mindset, by promoting vulnerability and openness. Three Pillars: Academic Excellence: strives to achieve and maintain maximal effort and performance in an institution of higher education. We pride ourselves in assuring that all members receive the tools for them to succeed in and out of the classroom. These resources include a test-bank, book-bank, study locations, tutoring services and while also providing directions for our members to adequate school resources that will also aid them on their academic journey. Community Service: engages in acts to uplift the local community as part of an effort to matriculate Latinos into higher education. Our goal is to provide back to our communities and to help inspire the next generation of Latinos to attend schools of higher education. This can be done through our partnerships with other community organizations and through our own sponsored events. Social Interaction: promotes professionalism and Hermandad through internal and external events. We hope that through these events, members are able to gain an opportunity to become better assimilated in society post-graduation. Members will learn the importance of building relationships and leveraging relationships in networking to build powerful lasting friendships while advancing professional careers.

Latine Film & Theatre Association (LFTA)

This organization strives to center Latine voices in creative spaces as well as create an annual theatre and film showcase that unites and empowers the Chicane/x & Latine/x community on campus. Our organization’s objective is to provide a space for students to discuss and address issues that the Latine community faces through the use of art and performance. We seek to be an inclusive organization both in the content we create and in our collaborations with various other organizations on campus. The Latine population has been historically underrepresented and misrepresented in the entertainment industry for far too long, and LFTA is working to change that with our productions. The content of our Night of Cultura Showcase shall vary each year in the attempt to address issues that are important and relevant to the Chicane/x & Latine/x community. Issues of politics, gender, sexuality, nationality, history, controversies, etc. and —most importantly— culture are to be the center of dramatic focus. In this way, The Night of Cultura Showcase offers two nights of entertainment, fun, laughter, reflection, but most importantly, empowerment and a sense of pride in the cultural richness of Latin America. The Latine Film and Theatre Association strives to promote a space where Latine creatives can express themselves truly and freely, learn skills within film and theater production, learn to navigate professional settings in film and theater, have fun while learning, feel supported in their creative endeavors, and form bonds and connections with other Latine creatives.
