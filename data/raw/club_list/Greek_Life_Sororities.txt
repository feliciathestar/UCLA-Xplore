Zeta Phi Beta Sorority - Nu Lambda Chapter

Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Incorporated is an international, historically black Greek-lettered sorority founded on January 16, 1920 by five collegiate women at Howard University. The sorority was founded on the simple belief that sorority elitism and socializing should not overshadow the real mission for progressive organizations - to address societal mores, ills, prejudices, poverty, and health concerns of the day. We were founded on four principles that our members still demonstrate today: Scholarship, Service, Sisterhood, and Finer Womanhood. On January 23, 1982, seven collegiate women at the University of California, Los Angeles chartered the Nu Lambda Chapter of Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc. Ever since, the ladies of Zeta have exemplified the principles of Zeta through campus programs, community service, and in their own personal endeavors. For more information about membership or future events, please email us: uclazetas@gmail.com.
