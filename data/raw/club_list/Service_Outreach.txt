Bridge at UCLA

Bridge at UCLA is a workshop and mentorship based program that aims to bridge educational gaps for underprivileged high school students. Through our research on current educational support efforts, we discovered a generational gap between established programs and the high school students they serve. Although these efforts are still impactful, the support is not as relevant to the current day academic and career atmosphere, and the connection between mentors and mentees is less meaningful. This inspired us to create a university based program that runs off current students that have relevant experience in these areas. Bridge at UCLA aims to increase graduation rates through a mentorship program between collegiate students (at UCLA) and low-income students between the 10-12 grade range in local public schools. Our intent strays from increasing application turnout; instead, focusing on building strong professional skills to demonstrate career paths stemming from a high school diploma. As undergraduates with firsthand experience within higher education and the job market, our initiative is unique and relevant to high schools. On campus, we will recruit students through club fairs and departmental advertisements. We will search for students who are motivated to help youth, and train them to lead workshops and become one-on-one mentors. The workshops will be focused on a 5 stage curriculum of skill building, as outlined in the presented Journey Map, including: resumes, interviewing, college advising, scholarship opportunities, and academic tutoring. However, a major aspect of this program will be its emphasis on existing opportunities that are available to students looking to join the workforce, utilizing skillful development from our program. The mentorship program fosters meaningful connections between volunteers and students to provide personalized support for creating a future pathway, with emphasis on empowerment and student-led connection during the program. Thus, rather than serving several students at once per mentor, we will cater the experience to be more individualized and direct. We will approach this initiative by partnering with schools in LAUSD, specifically those in low-income regions. This will personalize our approach to the schools because we will better understand what the students need, learning from both staff and students.

Community College Field Biology Alliance

The Community College Field Biology Alliance will provide community college students from underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) the opportunity to experience scientific field work prior to transferring to a four-year university. Students will be mentored by graduate students from UCLA’s Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology through all stages of an independent scientific project; from development of methods, to data collection on the UC James San Jacinto Mountains Reserve one of the 39 field sites apart of the University of California Natural Reserve System, to the write up of a scientific poster. Further, it is our goal to foster meaningful relationships between the student interns and the graduate student mentors that will last beyond just completion of their project. This will be accomplished through weekly and monthly meetings and community oriented social events. Lastly, during the duration of the program students will also be exposed to workshops and information sessions aimed at assisting in the transferring process and building tangible knowledge of scientific methods that can be applied in their future undergraduate research and graduate studies. Our program structure is as follows: (1) Community College students interested in the natural sciences and conducting scientific research in the field will be invited to apply to this program. The program will run from April to August, culminating in a 10 day trip to the field to collect data and the completion of a poster in time for the UCLA Summer Poster Symposium. (2) Students will be paired with UCLA graduate students in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department whose field research interests most closely align with their own. Students will meet virtually with their mentors weekly and in person monthly. Students and their mentors will develop an independent observational field project that could feasibly be completed with ten days of data collection during the summer. (3)By the beginning of July, students will have completed a literature review and a methods protocol for their proposed field project. In late July, students and graduate mentors will travel to the James San Jacinto Mountains Reserve. This reserve is located approximately 2 hours from UCLA in the San Bernardino National Forest and is a part of the University of California Natural Reserve System. Travel, food, and lodging will be included for all participants. (4) While in the field participants will be assisted by their graduate student mentors in collecting and analyzing data for their proposed project. Before returning home each student will have a completed scientific poster. (5) Aside from enacting their proposed research, students will attend skill-building workshops focused on cultivating tangible scientific and fieldwork skills that can be used throughout their careers. For example, interns will be introduced to ‘R’ Statistical software for data analysis and taught how to use species identification guides in the field.

EmpowHER

EmpowHER is committed to partnering with shelters for unhoused populations like the Los Angeles House of Ruth, orphanages in Tijuana such as Casa Hogar La Gloria, and non-profit organizations to uplift disadvantaged female-identifying individuals and children. EmpowHER seeks to raise awareness about and decrease the challenges disproportionately faced by unhoused and underserved female-identifying individuals, focusing on multilingual feminine hygiene and overall women's health education, dermatological health issues, and maternal psychiatric conditions. Additionally, we plan to extend our reach across borders by partnering with orphanages in Tijuana to improve health literacy, cultivate fulfilling mentorships, and support children’s health through donation drives and community outreach. To address disparities in basic needs access, EmpowHER will host drives to gather hygiene products, food, and clothing. Our next step would be to host workshops and assemble care packages/health kits to distribute to unhoused and underserved communities. We also plan to collaborate with local community partners and healthcare providers to offer free preventative health screenings and medical consultations in areas facing disparities in healthcare access. EmpowHER plans to engage medical students and faculty in every step of our volunteer efforts to advance health equity for all underserved female-identifying and child patient populations. We believe that housing inequities can have a profound impact on female-identifying individuals and children in underserved communities, and ensuring access to safe, affordable housing is essential to fostering stability, dignity, and opportunities for ensuring health equity.

Members of each committee will be responsible for contributing to their respective segments of the seminar and helping our organization provide an invaluable experience to aspiring healthcare professionals. MedReach members will also participate as mentors in our mentorship program to offer guidance curated to students’ academic, professional, and career goals. Our organization hopes to provide high school students will the tools and knowledge to better navigate the medical field and the limitless paths to reach their goals. While MedReach aims to serve high school students, this organization offers members a welcoming pre-health community in addition to social, networking, and volunteer opportunities.

Mobile Eye Clinic @ UCLA - Student Leadership Club

The Mobile Eye Clinic (UMEC) undergraduate club consists of students who volunteer with UCLA Jules Stein's Mobile Eye Clinic. UMEC and its staff of ophthalmologists, ophthalmology residents, technicians, and volunteers make visits to hundreds of Southern California community locations annually to deliver free vision care to underserved communities. Ophthalmologists perform free basic eye examinations to determine the need for prescriptive lenses and to rule out the need for further treatment of any eye condition or disease. The Student Leadership Club is an undergraduate-led division of UCLA Mobile Eye Clinic, providing dedicated and passionate individuals the opportunities to lead specialized committees, address issues, develop projects, and expand UCLA Mobile Eye Clinic's mission of providing free vision care to underserved communities around Los Angeles.

Neurodiversity Health Chats at UCLA

Neurodiversity Health Chats (NDHC) is originally a student led project (now club) led by Dr. Emily Hotez, Ph.D. and the UC-LEND clinic-- and funded by the Association of University Centers on Disabilities (AUCD)-- that seeks to improve the health and well-being of neurodivergent individuals through outreach and education. Since 2021, NDHC has improved access to resources and credible information for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD). NDHC is directly responsive to the well-established findings that neurodivergent populations have experienced disproportionate negative mental and physical health outcomes from the COVID-19 pandemic. NDHC applies a multi-pronged strategy to support neurodivergent populations. First, NDHC leverages social media to translate and disseminate valuable information on vaccination guidelines, needle anxieties, and barriers to vaccination. NDHC is highly adept at creating and disseminating plain language and accessible social media infographics through a range of channels, as well as conducting and sharing in-depth interviews with public health experts and individuals with lived experience. In addition to these outreach efforts, NDHC leads a portfolio of research. Last year, NDHC conducted a qualitative research study that analyzed key themes from interviews with medical and non-medical health professionals, communicators, and individuals with I/DD and their caregivers. Qualitative findings revealed that misinformation, vaccine risk perception, sensory sensitivities, and structural hardship were the most significant barriers to COVID-19 vaccination. In order to be responsive to the findings from our research study, NDHC embarked on the development and dissemination of a virtual CME/CE to promote vaccine confidence, access, and uptake in neurodivergent populations.

Science Lab Teaching Club at UCLA

The Science Lab Teaching Club was formed at UCLA Department of Physics and Astronomy in January 2012 under the scientific guidance of Dr. Konstantin Belov with several goals in mind, including: partially compensate the loss of the science teaching faculty at local public schools due to severe budget cuts; provide teaching experience for the undergraduate students majoring in physics and astronomy; spark interest in science in the next generation. The club members meet weekly during the school year to prepare lessons and practice lab demonstrations. The lessons on different STEM subjects are taught by the club members at local schools, catering to the interests of students of all age ranges. The emphasis is on teaching students in K-5 branches of physics such as electricity, magnetism, waves, and optics; however, we often branch out to other fields in STEM. Each lesson is accompanied by several spectacular demonstrations using the real laboratory equipment provided by the Department’s demo lab as well as presentations and additional demos designed and built by the club members. The club members strongly believe that in order to get children interested in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) subjects, science education should start at a very early age and each lesson should become a memorable experience for the kids. Club members have given presentations at the following schools: Norra Sterry Elementary School, Citizens of the World Mar Vista Charter School, Emerson Middle School, Palms Middle School, Fairburn Elementary School, Brentwood Science Magnet Elementary, and others. Undergraduate club member Nick Vincent has expressed his own enthusiasm for the program. "The Science Teaching Club at UCLA gave me a great way to become involved in the community," said Nick. "It encouraged me to use my passion for science to benefit local elementary schools. I think that my work with the Science Teaching Club has greatly augmented my education. The community service aspect has enriched my overall academic experience, the social aspect has allowed me to meet other physics students, and the cerebral challenge of designing quantum mechanics demonstrations for elementary school students truly engaged my mind."

Student Stroke Force

Recognizing the community need for stroke public education and awareness, the UCLA Stroke Force was formed in 1992 under the leadership and guidance of the late Dr. Sidney Starkman, Head of UCLA Emergency Neurology and Emergency Medicine Director of the UCLA Stroke Center. In the Stroke Force program, undergraduates are involved in double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter research projects investigating the efficacy of various drugs and procedures applied to the patients that arrive in the UCLA Emergency Room with onset of acute ischemic stroke. Students serve as research associates and work alongside neurologists during code strokes. Responsibilities include collecting information relating to the patient’s medical history and neurological deficits in order to identify potential candidates for enrollment in clinical trials that aim to find novel treatments for stroke. Students also serve as speakers who reach out to various communities. To date, more than 200 students have participated in the program, delivering over 300 lectures to over 7000 individuals. Formal testing has demonstrated that these presentations are highly effective, resulting in a significant increase in post-education stroke awareness. Through integrating experiences from clinical exposure in the Ronald Reagan Emergency Department, neurological rounds, health fairs, and presentations, this sect of the Stroke Program strives to provide a force to minimize response time and to facilitate treatment.

TechUp at UCLA

TechUp at UCLA is a student-run organization with the sole mission of the advocacy of technology literacy within the local community. It is an extension of a local non-profit, TechUp Los Angeles. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been forced to shift to remote working and video meetings that require some tech literacy skills. Yet, people experiencing homelessness may not have access to the technology needed to grow these skills. Given the existing hardships and disadvantages in the job market, learning tech literacy skills would help increase the amount and types of jobs this population can apply for. This can also be applied to other populations that struggle with tech literacy skills such as people from low income areas, elderly adults, and those who are returning from incarceration. While growing in tech literacy cannot knock down every barrier, having basic tech literacy skills brings us one step closer to an inclusive job market. Today, TechUp LA has partnered with seven local organizations throughout LA County where we provide monthly workshops to individuals on the basics of smartphones and computers. Thus, TechUp at UCLA hopes to amplify TechUp LA’s mission at UCLA and offer volunteer opportunities to current students to knock down technology barriers for underserved communities together.

Teens for Screens at UCLA

As part of efforts to come up with a new model for community outreach about breast cancer, UCSF's San Francisco Cancer Initiative Breast Cancer Task Force (SFCAN) discussed the idea of Teens for Screens (T4S) in 2018. In the course of numerous meetings and collaboration with community-based organizations geared toward the underserved population of San Francisco, the concept of creating a sustainable model of outreach to raise awareness of breast cancer among youth to educate their families and communities was developed. In addition to the support of SFCAN through the funding and resources they provided, the T4S pilot program would not have been possible without the leadership of Dr. Laura Fejerman, Dr. Ana Velasquez, Tania Dugatkin, and UCSF staff. We recognize them for the time, passion, support, and dedication they have contributed to T4S. In the Fall of 2019, T4S launched and empowered high school students with information to advocate for breast cancer screenings and healthy behaviors among their friends, families, and communities. In this vein, Teens for Screens at UCLA has adopted this model with a twist. To implement this model, UCLA Teens for Screens seeks to train undergraduate students as breast cancer educators to have them educate middle and high schoolers locally either in-person or remotely. As part of our outreach efforts, we aim to partner with high schools with high populations of underserved groups, such as low-income students and minorities, to provide them with information about breast cancer and the importance of screening. We also aim to provide one-on-one mentorship, with a culminating capstone project at the end of each program. As we continue this journey behind Teens for Screens, we hope that we can spread awareness about an often under-discussed, yet important issue.
