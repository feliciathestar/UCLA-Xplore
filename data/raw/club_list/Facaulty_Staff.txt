Jewish Faculty Resilience Group

The Jewish Faculty Resilience Group (JFrg) is a community of UCLA Jewish and non-Jewish faculty, postdoctoral researchers, and staff dedicated to supporting the Jewish community on campus. We work to identify and counter antisemitism at UCLA. We believe in peace and co-existence. We mourn the suffering, death, and/or destruction of all innocent civilians, including Israelis and Palestinians. MISSION: To mobilize to effectively identify and counter antisemitism at UCLA. To support the health, wellbeing, and safety of Jewish faculty, staff, students, and allies on campus, and Jewish people around the world, including the State of Israel. To champion authentic representations of Jewish history, culture, and religion, including that Jews constitute a diverse, multi-racial, ethnoreligious people indigenous to the land of Israel. To promote Zionism, defined as the Jewish people's national self-determination movement that advocates for their right to a sovereign country located in their ancestral homeland, the State of Israel. To recommend constructive solutions to the UC leadership to help them make UCLA a welcoming and safe space to live, work, and learn for everyone, including Jews. To take necessary and appropriate follow-up steps when campus antisemitism has not been taken seriously.
