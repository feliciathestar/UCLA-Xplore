Dukeminier Awards Journal of Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Law

Each year, scholars, lawyers, judges, and law students throughout the United States publish hundreds of articles concerning various aspects of sexual orientation and gender identity law. The Williams Institute and the UCLA School of Law students who staff the journal have initiated The Dukeminier Awards to acknowledge and distribute the best of these articles. The goals of the prizes are to encourage scholars to begin or continue writing about sexual orientation and gender identity law and public policy; provide valuable recognition and support for scholars, law students, and lawyers who write in this area; and provide easy access to each year’s best scholarly materials for those outside of legal academia, including lawyers, judges, other legal actors, and policy makers.

OutWrite Newsmagazine

OutWrite Newsmagazine is the official queer newsmagazine of the University of California, Los Angeles. OutWrite strives to build a growing educational platform through a multi-media approach that uplifts and empowers the often silenced voices of the incredibly diverse queer community. We aim to challenge dominant cisheteronormative narratives through an unapologetically anti-queerphobic, anti-racist, and progressive lens. OutWrite was established in 1979 under its original title TenPercent, becoming the first queer college publication in the country. The name TenPercent was chosen from the Alfred Kinsey’s study Sexual Behavior in the Human Male which stated that 10% of men identified as homosexual. In 2005, the newsmagazine’s staff petitioned to change the name to OutWrite to decenter the white, cis, gay male identity and use a name which better represents the queer community’s vast spectrum of identities. Throughout the years, the newsmagazine referred to itself as a "gay and lesbian" newsmagazine, slowly adding more identities to its moniker just as the mainstream community did in the late 20th century. Our label has since been changed to "queer" newsmagazine to recognize both the importance of inclusivity in our community and the inherent radical nature of our mission; queer is a verb and political statement as much as it is an umbrella descriptor encompassing the ever-growing LGBTQ+ acronym. OutWrite is proud to transform and adapt itself to better represent and serve queer people, changing its own identity as our community grows and changes.

Pride Alliance at DGSOM

Pride Alliance is a support network for UCLA medical students, residents and faculty who identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, intersex, queer, asexual, two-spirit, questioning, and allies. Our mission is based on three pillars: Networking: As a student and faculty organization, we strive to provide networking and educational opportunities to connect with health professionals and students. We will facilitate mentoring and both personal and professional growth opportunities for students, faculty, and staff members. Advocacy: As a student organization, we strive to educate the School of Medicine and university communities about health issues facing LGBTQ+ patients and advocate on their behalf for competent and compassionate care. We believe that all physicians, future physicians, and medical personnel should know the health inequities faced by LGBTQ+ communities. Service: The LGBTQ+ community is predisposed to experience health disparities such as with mental health, cancer, and access. It is up to us as future health care professionals to address them. We will work closely with the LGBTQ+ community in Los Angeles and at UCLA to address these disparities.

QTPOCC

The Queer and Trans People of Color Collective is an intentional space by and for people of color in the queer community on the law school campus. We specifically welcome people who identify as a racial minority under the LGBTQIA umbrella. Although UCLA has a true reputation of inclusivity for racial minorities and queer folks, we are focused on creating a space for those who are at the intersection of being a queer or trans person of color. As QTPOC, we are already minorities in almost every space, but the legal field in particular highlights our lack of representation. The particular adversity we face allows very few of us to clear the hurdles of entry to this powerful institution. As we overcome these challenges and more of us enter the legal profession, we established the Queer and Trans People of Color Collective to provide a welcome home for those who come after us so that we may work together to carry our community forward.

Queer Alliance

Queer Alliance at UCLA was formed to provide a bridge between all progressive LGBTQ+ organizations dealing with issues that touch people who are traditionally disadvantaged on the basis of sexual orientation, romantic attraction, gender expression, and/or gender identity. Queer Alliance recognizes the existence of past conflicts and tension amongst groups of various cultures and seeks to address these issues by serving as a bastion of greater understanding to which all interested parties can look towards as an example of the true spirit of cooperation through facilitation. The alliance looks forwards to maintaining its commitment to respect, understanding, equity, and equality while underscoring the need for the eradication of heteronormativity, queerphobia, and cisheterosexism outside and within the community at UCLA. These goals are achieved by fostering spaces wherein community can thrive, and engaging in social programming and advocacy efforts.
