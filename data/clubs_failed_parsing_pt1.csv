As the representative organization for over 1000+ student organizations at UCLA, we are accordingly interested in promoting the varied interests of this diverse body. We recognize that this objective may seem formidable, ambitious even. After all, it is difficult to represent such a disparate array of clubs, teams and organizations. However, rather than bemoan such a daunting task, we are instead committed to embracing this immense diversity; which paints our campus in different strokes and which allows us both to appreciate the uniqueness within ourselves as well as in others. Moreover, we do not see UCLA as an isolated outpost in the greater Los Angeles area, disconnected and aloof from its surrounding environment. Instead, we see the two entities as active partners in a fruitful relationship that is continuing to evolve in significant and important ways. Thus, not only do we hope to advocate student engagement on campus, but we also hope to extend that engagement to the community of Los Angeles.

"Bridge at UCLA is a workshop and mentorship based program that aims to bridge educational gaps for underprivileged high school students. Through our research on current educational support efforts, we discovered a generational gap between established programs and the high school students they serve. Although these efforts are still impactful, the support is not as relevant to the current day academic and career atmosphere, and the connection between mentors and mentees is less meaningful. This inspired us to create a university based program that runs off current students that have relevant experience in these areas. Bridge at UCLA aims to increase graduation rates through a mentorship program between collegiate students (at UCLA) and low-income students between the 10-12 grade range in local public schools. Our intent strays from increasing application turnout; instead, focusing on building strong professional skills to demonstrate career paths stemming from a high school diploma. As undergraduates with firsthand experience within higher education and the job market, our initiative is unique and relevant to high schools. On campus, we will recruit students through club fairs and departmental advertisements. We will search for students who are motivated to help youth, and train them to lead workshops and become one-on-one mentors. The workshops will be focused on a 5 stage curriculum of skill building, as outlined in the presented Journey Map, including: resumes, interviewing, college advising, scholarship opportunities, and academic tutoring. However, a major aspect of this program will be its emphasis on existing opportunities that are available to students looking to join the workforce, utilizing skillful development from our program. The mentorship program fosters meaningful connections between volunteers and students to provide personalized support for creating a future pathway, with emphasis on empowerment and student-led connection during the program. Thus, rather than serving several students at once per mentor, we will cater the experience to be more individualized and direct. We will approach this initiative by partnering with schools in LAUSD, specifically those in low-income regions. This will personalize our approach to the schools because we will better understand what the students need, learning from both staff and students.",Category:,,,,,,,,

"The Community College Field Biology Alliance will provide community college students from underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) the opportunity to experience scientific field work prior to transferring to a four-year university. Students will be mentored by graduate students from UCLA’s Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology through all stages of an independent scientific project; from development of methods, to data collection on the UC James San Jacinto Mountains Reserve one of the 39 field sites apart of the University of California Natural Reserve System, to the write up of a scientific poster. Further, it is our goal to foster meaningful relationships between the student interns and the graduate student mentors that will last beyond just completion of their project. This will be accomplished through weekly and monthly meetings and community oriented social events. Lastly, during the duration of the program students will also be exposed to workshops and information sessions aimed at assisting in the transferring process and building tangible knowledge of scientific methods that can be applied in their future undergraduate research and graduate studies. Our program structure is as follows: (1) Community College students interested in the natural sciences and conducting scientific research in the field will be invited to apply to this program. The program will run from April to August, culminating in a 10 day trip to the field to collect data and the completion of a poster in time for the UCLA Summer Poster Symposium. (2) Students will be paired with UCLA graduate students in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department whose field research interests most closely align with their own. Students will meet virtually with their mentors weekly and in person monthly. Students and their mentors will develop an independent observational field project that could feasibly be completed with ten days of data collection during the summer. (3)By the beginning of July, students will have completed a literature review and a methods protocol for their proposed field project. In late July, students and graduate mentors will travel to the James San Jacinto Mountains Reserve. This reserve is located approximately 2 hours from UCLA in the San Bernardino National Forest and is a part of the University of California Natural Reserve System. Travel, food, and lodging will be included for all participants. (4) While in the field participants will be assisted by their graduate student mentors in collecting and analyzing data for their proposed project. Before returning home each student will have a completed scientific poster. (5) Aside from enacting their proposed research, students will attend skill-building workshops focused on cultivating tangible scientific and fieldwork skills that can be used throughout their careers. For example, interns will be introduced to ‘R’ Statistical software for data analysis and taught how to use species identification guides in the field.",Category:,,,,,,,,

"The Science Lab Teaching Club was formed at UCLA Department of Physics and Astronomy in January 2012 under the scientific guidance of Dr. Konstantin Belov with several goals in mind, including: partially compensate the loss of the science teaching faculty at local public schools due to severe budget cuts; provide teaching experience for the undergraduate students majoring in physics and astronomy; spark interest in science in the next generation. The club members meet weekly during the school year to prepare lessons and practice lab demonstrations. The lessons on different STEM subjects are taught by the club members at local schools, catering to the interests of students of all age ranges. The emphasis is on teaching students in K-5 branches of physics such as electricity, magnetism, waves, and optics; however, we often branch out to other fields in STEM. Each lesson is accompanied by several spectacular demonstrations using the real laboratory equipment provided by the Department’s demo lab as well as presentations and additional demos designed and built by the club members. The club members strongly believe that in order to get children interested in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) subjects, science education should start at a very early age and each lesson should become a memorable experience for the kids. Club members have given presentations at the following schools: Norra Sterry Elementary School, Citizens of the World Mar Vista Charter School, Emerson Middle School, Palms Middle School, Fairburn Elementary School, Brentwood Science Magnet Elementary, and others. Undergraduate club member Nick Vincent has expressed his own enthusiasm for the program. ""The Science Teaching Club at UCLA gave me a great way to become involved in the community,"" said Nick. ""It encouraged me to use my passion for science to benefit local elementary schools. I think that my work with the Science Teaching Club has greatly augmented my education. The community service aspect has enriched my overall academic experience, the social aspect has allowed me to meet other physics students, and the cerebral challenge of designing quantum mechanics demonstrations for elementary school students truly engaged my mind.""",Category:,,,,,,,,

In the Stroke Force program, undergraduates are involved in double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter research projects investigating the efficacy of various drugs and procedures applied to the patients that arrive in the UCLA Emergency Room with onset of acute ischemic stroke. Students serve as research associates and work alongside neurologists during code strokes. Responsibilities include collecting information relating to the patient’s medical history and neurological deficits in order to identify potential candidates for enrollment in clinical trials that aim to find novel treatments for stroke. Students also serve as speakers who reach out to various communities. To date, more than 200 students have participated in the program, delivering over 300 lectures to over 7000 individuals. Formal testing has demonstrated that these presentations are highly effective, resulting in a significant increase in post-education stroke awareness. Through integrating experiences from clinical exposure in the Ronald Reagan Emergency Department, neurological rounds, health fairs, and presentations, this sect of the Stroke Program strives to provide a force to minimize response time and to facilitate treatment.",Category:,,,,,,,,

"TechUp at UCLA is a student-run organization with the sole mission of the advocacy of technology literacy within the local community. It is an extension of a local non-profit, TechUp Los Angeles. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been forced to shift to remote working and video meetings that require some tech literacy skills. Yet, people experiencing homelessness may not have access to the technology needed to grow these skills. Given the existing hardships and disadvantages in the job market, learning tech literacy skills would help increase the amount and types of jobs this population can apply for. This can also be applied to other populations that struggle with tech literacy skills such as people from low income areas, elderly adults, and those who are returning from incarceration. While growing in tech literacy cannot knock down every barrier, having basic tech literacy skills brings us one step closer to an inclusive job market. Today, TechUp LA has partnered with seven local organizations throughout LA County where we provide monthly workshops to individuals on the basics of smartphones and computers. Thus, TechUp at UCLA hopes to amplify TechUp LA’s mission at UCLA and offer volunteer opportunities to current students to knock down technology barriers for underserved communities together.",Category:,,,,,,,,

"OutWrite Newsmagazine is the official queer newsmagazine of the University of California, Los Angeles. OutWrite strives to build a growing educational platform through a multi-media approach that uplifts and empowers the often silenced voices of the incredibly diverse queer community. We aim to challenge dominant cisheteronormative narratives through an unapologetically anti-queerphobic, anti-racist, and progressive lens. OutWrite was established in 1979 under its original title TenPercent, becoming the first queer college publication in the country. The name TenPercent was chosen from the Alfred Kinsey’s study Sexual Behavior in the Human Male which stated that 10% of men identified as homosexual. In 2005, the newsmagazine’s staff petitioned to change the name to OutWrite to decenter the white, cis, gay male identity and use a name which better represents the queer community’s vast spectrum of identities. Throughout the years, the newsmagazine referred to itself as a ""gay and lesbian"" newsmagazine, slowly adding more identities to its moniker just as the mainstream community did in the late 20th century. Our label has since been changed to ""queer"" newsmagazine to recognize both the importance of inclusivity in our community and the inherent radical nature of our mission; queer is a verb and political statement as much as it is an umbrella descriptor encompassing the ever-growing LGBTQ+ acronym. OutWrite is proud to transform and adapt itself to better represent and serve queer people, changing its own identity as our community grows and changes.",Category:,,,,,,,,

"The chief goal of the Philosophy Club is to provide a space for students to share and discuss ideas in an open-minded, friendly and respectful environment. This is a place where you can grapple with philosophical questions, and we can mutually work together to try to better our understanding of the world, our behavior within it, and whether or not we are justified in our beliefs. Whether you have only a budding interest in philosophy or if you are well versed in philosophical discourse, the club is a great way to expand your knowledge of the field and make friends along the way. WEEKLY MEETING Meetings are held every Tuesday at 6 pm in Dodd 399 (On Discord https://discord.gg/8YcZ3Uu during pandemics). During meetings, we discuss a specific philosophical issue for about an hour and a half. Topics are chosen and presented by any club members and often explore topics not commonly covered in undergraduate courses, e.g.: philosophy of progress, experience machine, and animal rights. We encourage you to present your own ideas! Sometimes we host philosophy-themed movie nights instead. We often go to Westwood for dinner after our weekly meetings to continue the discussion. MEDITATIONS PHILOSOPHY JOURNAL Meditations is the undergraduate journal of philosophy at UCLA. The purpose of the journal is to foster philosophical thought and provide an opportunity for undergraduates to gain writing and publishing experience. Maybe you have a philosophy paper that you’re really proud of, or you’re looking for a platform to test your arguments and be challenged. Maybe you have some cool ideas but hate writing when a grade depends on it. We encourage undergraduates of any major to participate in Meditations. BOOKCLUBS You can also be a part of our book club. The book club offers a chance to do a close reading of philosophical texts. During our weekly discussions, we will try to understand the ideas presented in the readings by breaking down nuances such as rhetoric and symbolism. OTHER PROGRAMS We encourage members to attend events organized by the Philosophy Department. We also cooperate with the department to plan events for you. For example coffee time with professors, study lounge, and information panel, and more. Facebook: Undergraduate Philosophy Club at UCLA",Category:,,,,,,,,

Markdown Content:,"The Music Meditation Club offers students a serene and supportive environment to relax, recharge, and explore the profound benefits of mindfulness and meditation through music. In today’s fast-paced world, students face immense academic, social, and personal pressures, making it essential to have a space where they can find peace and balance. Our club is a haven for those seeking a mindful outlet to destress, connect, and rediscover their inner calm. At the heart of our activities is the practice of mantra meditation, with a particular focus on the Hare Krishna mantra. This timeless chant has been cherished for centuries as a means to achieve mental clarity, emotional resilience, and spiritual connection. Chanting this mantra is not only a meditative practice but also an uplifting and joyous experience. The rhythmic repetition of sacred sounds helps quiet the mind, allowing participants to immerse themselves in the present moment and develop a deeper sense of self-awareness and harmony. In addition to mantra meditation, the club offers a variety of other mindfulness-based activities designed to support students’ well-being: Guided Meditations: Our guided meditation sessions are carefully designed to help participants release tension, focus their thoughts, and cultivate mindfulness. Led by experienced facilitators, these sessions cater to both beginners and seasoned practitioners, making it easy for anyone to join and benefit from this practice. Sound Baths: Experience the healing power of sound with our immersive sound bath sessions. Using instruments like singing bowls, gongs, and chimes, these sessions create a sonic environment that promotes deep relaxation and rejuvenation. The resonant tones and vibrations wash over participants, helping to dissolve stress, improve focus, and restore balance to the mind and body. Workshops and Discussions: We regularly host workshops and discussions that delve into the philosophy and science of meditation, mindfulness, and sound healing. These events are an excellent opportunity for members to deepen their understanding of meditation practices and explore their impact on mental health and personal growth. Community and Connection: Beyond the meditative practices, the Music Meditation Club is a place to connect with like-minded individuals who share an interest in music, mindfulness, and self-care. Our supportive community encourages open dialogue, shared experiences, and meaningful connections. Our mission is to empower students to take charge of their mental and emotional well-being by integrating music and meditation into their daily lives. Whether you’re looking to reduce stress, improve focus, or simply explore a new hobby, the Music Meditation Club welcomes you with open arms.","Self Improvement - Meditation, Health and Wellness",,,,,,,

We do so by hosting events, workshops, and speakers that tackle issues such as exercise, eating disorders, body dysmorphia, mental health, and self esteem. Living as college students in Los Angeles, we want to help students understand how influenced we all are by media images and we want to give students the tools to combat these influences. The media has given us a specific image of what is beautiful, and we want to encourage every student on campus to feel confident and beautiful no matter how their body looks. By improving our self esteem, we can focus less time on our physical appearance and more time on living our lives. We hope to enhance the self esteem of students by demonstrating beauty isn’t only skin-deep, and by pushing students to be positive with themselves and not to be so critical. We also want to show how physical health affects mental health. We want to teach students ways to take care of their own health which will help them feel better. For instance we emphasize healthy eating and fitness, but encourage individuals to focus on feeling good rather than looking good. We want to make help accessible to those who are struggling with body dismorphia or eating disorders. Through our programming, we hope to educate the student body on these issues and how to tackle them. The Body Image Task Force also aims to help students learn how to handle college stress. We hope to provide stress outlets because we believe that mental health is also connected to self esteem and in general happiness. As students, we all face a variety of obstacles that can ultimately hold us back. We hope to reduce these personal barriers to help each student here reach their full potential.","Health and Wellness, Student Government - USAC Affiliated",Social Media:,,,,,,

American Institute of Chemical Engineers,"The American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) is a professional organization for chemical engineers. AIChE was established in 1908 with the purpose of establishing chemical engineers as a profession independent from chemists and mechanical engineers. The mission of the AIChE student chapter at UCLA is to promote excellence in the Chemical Engineering Department of the School of Engineering and Applied Science by providing resources and support to the undergraduate students so that they can succeed academically and advance professionally. AIChE's vision is to provide value as the global leader of the chemical engineering profession and be the lifetime center for professional and personal growth. In 1908 a small group of chemical engineers formed a professional society to promote and improve chemical engineering as a discipline. At first, the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) met with strong resistance, especially from the American Chemical Society (ACS), which claimed control over all pure and applied chemistry in the United States. In response, AIChE adopted a number of conservative measures, including strict membership criteria to keep membership low and avoid competition with ACS. Nonetheless, the value of AIChE was realized by the entire discipline in 1925, when chemical engineering became the first profession to use scholastic accreditation to ensure the consistency and quality of academic chemical engineering courses. The conservative attitude paid off when peace was made between ACS and AIChE around 1930. The membership criteria were lifted and chemical engineers joined in droves. Today AIChE remains the principal chemical engineering professional society in the United States. Currently about 57,000 (~70%) of American chemical engineers are members.","Engineering, Academic",Website:,,,,,,
